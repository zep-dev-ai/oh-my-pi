//! Host plumbing for utility builtins (`cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `ls`, …).
//!
//! These builtins are ports of standalone command-line utilities: synchronous
//! programs that read `argv`, talk to fd 0/1/2, resolve relative paths against
//! the current directory, and exit with a status. [`Host`] hands them exactly
//! that view of the shell they run inside — as a value, threaded explicitly —
//! so no process-global or thread-local I/O state is involved: output lands on
//! the command's (possibly redirected or piped) file descriptors and relative
//! paths resolve against the *shell's* working directory rather than the host
//! process's.
//!
//! A utility implements [`Utility`]: a `clap` argument model plus a synchronous
//! [`Utility::run`] body. [`util`] wraps that into a [`Registration`] which
//!
//! 1. materializes process-substitution arguments (`diff <(a) <(b)`) into real
//!    file descriptors,
//! 2. parses `argv`, rendering `--help`/`--version` on stdout and usage errors
//!    on stderr with the utility's own exit status,
//! 3. runs the body on a blocking thread, so a slow utility never stalls the
//!    async runtime and concurrent pipeline stages stay isolated,
//! 4. observes the shell's cancellation token (abort/`timeout`), and
//! 5. contains panics at the builtin boundary instead of taking down the
//!    long-lived host process.

// The whole module is API consumed by the feature-gated utility modules; a build
// with no utility features enabled legitimately uses none of it.
