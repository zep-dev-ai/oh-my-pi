/**
 * Thinking-loop guard.
 *
 * Gemini models (notably `gemini-3.5-flash` via OpenRouter) occasionally fall
 * into a degenerate reasoning loop: they re-emit the same paragraph intent over
 * and over with cosmetic wording drift ("Confirming Safety", "Verifying
 * Completion", …), burning the entire output budget without ever calling a tool
 * or answering. The runaway is *not* byte-identical, so a cheap verbatim
 * tail-repeat check alone misses it.
 *
 * This guard watches the streamed `thinking` deltas and, on a match, terminates
 * the stream with a synthetic `error` {@link AssistantMessage} that carries
 * **no observable content**. An empty-content `stopReason: "error"` message tagged
 * with `AIError.Flag.ThinkingLoop` lets result consumers and `AgentSession` discard
 * the runaway and re-sample instead of committing garbage transcript.
 *
 * Three failure shapes are detected:
 * 1. **Verbatim tail repetition** — a short unit repeated back-to-back (e.g.
 *    "🌊 🌊 🌊 …"). Caught from a rolling 250-char tail.
 * 2. **Near-duplicate segments** — paragraphs that normalize to the same
 *    word-trigram fingerprint. Caught with a Jaccard window over recent
 *    paragraphs. Thresholds were calibrated on a real loop transcript plus
 *    13.5k non-loop thinking blocks (zero false positives; hardest negative
 *    scored 3 against the trigger of 4).
 * 3. **Progress-lexicon stall** — paragraphs that keep reshuffling the same
 *    motivational filler ("just doing it, pushing ahead, maintaining momentum")
 *    into fresh word order, so trigrams never match, yet introduce no new
 *    vocabulary and name nothing concrete. Caught by a run of low-novelty,
 *    anchor-free segments; a segment naming a path/identifier resets the run, so
 *    genuine but vocabulary-repetitive work (per-file templates) is spared.
 *
 * Scope is narrow: guarded Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok family streams before any tool call. Native
 * thinking is checked first; assistant text can also be checked for providers
 * that surface reasoning as visible prose. On a hit the failed turn is emitted as
 * an empty retryable stream-stall error; result-awaiting callers (`complete`,
 * `completeSimple`) re-sample it a few times and then let a stubborn loop cook
 * through one unguarded pass. Disable detection with `PI_NO_THINKING_LOOP_GUARD=1`.
