/**
 * Minimal TUI implementation with differential rendering.
 *
 * Append-only render contract: rows committed to native scrollback are
 * immutable — the tape is the terminal's visual record. Whatever scrolls
 * above the window enters history exactly once, in order: as exact-final
 * bytes when the component seam (`NativeScrollbackLiveRegion`) declared them
 * final, else as a frozen snapshot of what was on screen. When recorded
 * history diverges from the frame (a finalized block replacing its
 * scrolled-off live render), the engine erases and replays (ED3, `CSI 3 J`)
 * so history holds the content exactly once — the same replay used for
 * gestures (session replace, resize, resetDisplay). Multiplexer panes, where
 * ED3 is unsafe, instead re-anchor and recommit below the stale fragment —
 * duplication, never loss. The engine never probes or guesses the terminal's
 * scroll position, and the hot path clamps over-wide lines instead of
 * throwing. See `docs/tui-core-renderer.md`.
