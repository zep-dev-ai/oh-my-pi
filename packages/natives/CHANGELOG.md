# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [17.3.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Fixed `omp` failing to start on a clean Windows install with `Failed to load pi_natives native addon for win32-x64 ... The specified module could not be found` (LoadLibrary error 126). The shipped win32-x64 addon linked the dynamic MSVC CRT (`/MD`) and imported `VCRUNTIME140.dll` from the Visual C++ Redistributable, which is absent on a fresh Windows install. The addon now statically links the CRT (`+crt-static` for rustc plus the `static_link_msvcrt` cc feature for its C dependencies), so the `.node` imports only core Windows system DLLs ([#8439](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/8439)).

## [17.3.0] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where shell-internal background jobs (such as `yes >/dev/null &`) could survive a one-shot shell session and consume CPU indefinitely after the command returned.

## [17.2.12] - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- Consolidated every shell builtin into one crate, `crates/pi-builtins` (the renamed and de-vendored `brush-builtins` fork), with one module per command. The 46 `crates/vendor/uu-*` crates, `crates/vendor/jaq`, `crates/pi-uu-grep`, `crates/pi-uu-diff`, and everything that had accumulated inline in `pi-shell` (`fd`, `cmp`, `which`, the moreutils set, and the `ps`/`top`/`pgrep`/`pkill`/`pidwait`/`kill`/`sleep`/`timeout`/`nohup` process builtins) now live beside the bash builtins they sit next to at runtime, and register through `pi_builtins::utility_builtins()` and `pi_builtins::process_builtins()`. `pi-shell/src/shell.rs` shrank by ~4,200 lines.

### Fixed

- Fixed `sort --compress-program` spawning its compressor and decompressor without the shell's working directory or exported environment, so a program installed only on the shell's `PATH` was not found, and with stderr inherited from the host process, where its diagnostics could corrupt the TUI. Both children now launch through the shell's child context and their stderr is forwarded to the command's own file descriptor.
- Fixed `realpath -q` exiting 0 after a failed operand; it suppresses the diagnostic but now reports failure, matching GNU.

### Removed

- Removed `crates/pi-uutils-ctx`. Utility builtins previously reached their stdio, working directory, and environment through a thread-local context installed around each invocation; they now receive an explicit `Host` value (`pi-builtins/src/host.rs`) carrying the command's file descriptors, the shell working directory, the exported environment, cancellation, and the accumulated exit status. The uutils entry-point plumbing (`uumain`, `UResult`/`UError`, `set_exit_code`, `crate_version!`) went with it; each utility is now an ordinary brush builtin implementing `host::Utility`.

## [17.2.11] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added support for Windows hosts in `bun run build`, enabling local N-API builds against VS Build Tools without requiring a pre-configured vcvars prompt.

### Changed

- Replaced the miniaudio (`maudio`) dependency with in-house platform audio backends for `AudioCapture`/`AudioPlayback`: CoreAudio AudioQueue on macOS, shared-mode WASAPI on Windows, and PulseAudio (ALSA fallback) loaded via `dlopen` on Linux. Removes the bindgen/libclang requirement and the Windows rustc-ICE workaround from the native build.

### Fixed

- Fixed CPU feature detection (AVX2) on Windows hosts, resolving an issue where the native addon loader and local builds incorrectly fell back to the baseline variant, while improving startup performance by ~270ms.
- Fixed `bun run build:bindings` failing on Windows due to incorrect resolution of the `@napi-rs/cli` entry point.
- Fixed a compiler crash (rustc ICE) when building the `maudio` package for Windows.
- Fixed synthesized macOS keyboard and pointer events suppressing physical user input.
- Fixed several Wayland input and capture issues, including preventing read-only calls from acquiring persistent input control, fixing GNOME Wayland pointer input initialization, and resolving conflicts between `libei` input and PipeWire screen capture.
- Fixed compilation of the `wayland-pipewire` Cargo feature.
- Improved security on Wayland by cleaning up orphaned world-readable RemoteDesktop restore tokens on startup.

## [17.2.10] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Fixed per-window capture failing on Wayland with `InvalidTarget` errors for window IDs returned by `desktop.windows()`.
- Fixed `desktop.capabilities()` incorrectly reporting `capture: true` on Wayland builds compiled without the `wayland-pipewire` feature.

## [17.2.9] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- Bounded fuzzy-find scored-match retention to the top-K results (worst-first heap) instead of collecting and fully sorting every hit; ranking and totals are unchanged ([#7415](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7415)).

### Fixed

- Fixed newer OMP versions deleting a freshly created older native addon cache directory during concurrent startup, which could interrupt extraction with `ENOENT`.

## [17.2.7] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added missing procps/BSD output format specifiers and aliases to the in-process `ps` shell builtin, including support for columns like `tpgid`, `pri`, `flags`, `wchan`, and various user/group/time fields.
- Updated `ps -j` to include the TPGID column, `ps -l` to display the single-character S column, and the STAT column to support the `+` foreground process group flag.

## [17.2.6] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added non-blocking, process-owned `FileLock` bindings using abstract Unix sockets on Linux, named mutexes on Windows, and persistent `flock(2)` sidecars on other Unix platforms.

## [17.2.5] - 2026-08-03

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced DesktopSession.execute(actions, window) and action batches with dedicated per-operation methods for capture, pointer, keyboard, window, and accessibility. Capture capabilities now apply per call, and coordinate input requires a prior frame for the same target.

### Added

- Added a cross-platform, in-process ps shell builtin supporting BSD/procps selection forms, custom output columns, sorting, process metrics, and header suppression.
- Added unified desktop backends for macOS, Win32, X11, and Wayland behind a single session API, featuring capture-free window discovery, isolated capture, explicit background/foreground delivery, native accessibility trees (AX/UIA/AT-SPI) with generational references, and structured errors for unsupported background input.

### Fixed

- Fixed accessibility snapshots incorrectly marking a window root as focused based on its app-local AXFocused attribute when another application held global focus; the root annotation now correctly reflects the global window-roster focus flag.
- Improved coordinate-frame error messages for pointer input before capture, out-of-frame coordinates, and between-display points to clearly explain the capture-frame contract and remedy instead of throwing a generic bounds check.
- Fixed duplicated characters in AppKit targets on macOS caused by background keyboard events being posted through both CoreGraphics and SkyLight; events are now delivered once via the authenticated SkyLight route.

## [17.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Updated native HTML-to-Markdown rendering to html-to-markdown-rs 3.9.2 defaults, which may result in formatting differences (such as fenced code blocks and cycling nested-list bullets) compared to version 2.30.0.

### Fixed

- Fixed a heap corruption crash when opening PulseAudio on Linux ARM64 by shipping target-specific miniaudio Rust layouts for GNU and musl native addons.
- Fixed local Bazel addon builds on NixOS by exposing system CMake tools to sandboxed build scripts and correctly bundling Opus.
- Fixed workspace native addon loading to correctly prefer the workspace build over an installed leaf package.
- Fixed process crashes caused by pathological HTML inputs; conversions that exceed the native-stack DOM depth limit now reject instead of returning silently truncated Markdown.

## [17.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Fixed the `computer` tool advertising Wayland support that never worked: on the default rootless XWayland (GNOME/KDE/sway) the X11 root window has no readable pixmap, so root `GetImage` failed on every screenshot with a raw `BadMatch` protocol dump. `Monitor::all` now probes root drawability at initialization and fails fast with an actionable `DESKTOP_BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` message naming the rootless-XWayland constraint, and `docs/computer-use.md` now lists rootless XWayland as unsupported ([#7085](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7085)).

## [17.2.0] - 2026-07-30

### Changed

- Split the native voice engine (miniaudio capture/playback, WebRTC peer, Opus media) out of the `pi-natives` addon crate into a napi-free `pi-voice` rlib. The addon keeps thin `#[napi]` adapters, so the JS API is unchanged; the webrtc/opus/miniaudio dependency graph now compiles once into the library and no longer rebuilds with the addon leaf (which recompiles every release via its version-sentinel edit).
- Release binaries now build in parallel with the test fan-out; npm leaf publishing moved to a dedicated post-validation job (`release_native_leaves`), and darwin release bazel caches are pre-warmed on native-affecting main pushes — cutting release wall time from the previous serialized tests → cold darwin build pipeline.

## [17.1.8] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue on macOS (darwin) where the native addon delivered zero AudioCapture callbacks, which prevented microphone audio from being captured.

## [17.1.6] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- CI now exports Bazel disk caches only after exact misses and reuses one native addon artifact across Linux test and release jobs. macOS release jobs now build only their own architecture.
- Native addons now build with Bazel (rules_rust + hermetic zig cc toolchains for linux-gnu/musl, host Xcode for darwin, and a hermetic clang-cl + xwin toolchain for windows-msvc) instead of the napi CLI + cargo-zigbuild/cargo-xwin pipeline. `bun run build` drives `scripts/bazel-natives.ts`; TypeScript binding regeneration moved to `bun run build:bindings` (needed only when the Rust API surface changes). CI caches through a content-addressed bazel-remote action cache instead of sccache + target-directory snapshots, cutting warm native rebuilds from ~20 minutes to seconds and cold cache-hit builds to ~2.5 minutes.

### Fixed

- napi binding build failures now surface the exit code and the tail of stdout/stderr instead of a bare "napi build failed" message ([#6799](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6799)).
- Silenced cross-platform Rust build warnings: dead-code on unix-only fields/helpers in `pi-uutils-ctx`, `pi-shell` (fd owner filters, coreutils argv), and vendored `uu-find`/`uu-stat` when compiling for Windows, and deprecated `libc::time_t` casts in `pi-iso` on musl. `pi-walker` now declares the `windows-sys` features it uses (`Win32_Foundation`, `Win32_Security`, `Win32_Storage_FileSystem`, `Win32_System_IO`) instead of relying on workspace-wide feature unification.

## [17.1.5] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Fixed the native `sort` builtin panicking with `SendError(..)` at `chunks.rs:248` when the chunk-channel receiver disconnected early (e.g. a consumer thread stopping after an error or closed output); the reader now stops gracefully instead of unwrapping the failed send, and a panicking external-sort worker thread is surfaced as an error instead of silently emitting truncated output ([#6736](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6736)).

## [17.1.4] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Added the `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives/desktop` factory entry, which defers native addon loading until a desktop worker initializes its session.

### Fixed

- Fixed Linux native audio over forwarded PulseAudio servers: capture now handles 125 ms Android fragments without stalling, and playback buffers enough audio to avoid TCP underruns and stuttering ([#6628](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6628) by [@anatoli-tsinovoy](https://github.com/anatoli-tsinovoy)).
- Fixed older running OMP versions deleting newer native addon cache directories during cleanup, which could race a new version's first-run extraction and crash with `ENOENT`.
- Fixed macOS computer screenshots occasionally returning the pre-action frame instead of reflecting completed keyboard and pointer input ([#6595](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/6595) by [@wolfiesch](https://github.com/wolfiesch)).

## [17.1.3] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- `astEdit` without an explicit `lang` now rewrites mixed-language paths per file (each file parsed in its own inferred language, patterns compiled per language) instead of erroring when the path/glob spans multiple languages. A pattern that parses in no discovered language is still reported (or fails the call under `failOnParseError`); files whose language cannot be inferred surface as per-file parse errors instead of aborting the whole call.

## [17.1.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Fixed native addon builds with CMake 4.x (bundled opus policy floor) and stopped passing `-C target-cpu=native` on darwin arm64, which baked build-host CPU features into shipped addons and broke `ring` compilation.

## [17.1.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Added native `AudioCapture`, `AudioPlayback`, and `LiveWebRtcPeer` classes for low-latency microphone capture, gapless speaker playback, and WebRTC offer/answer sessions with Opus media and `oai-events` data-channel delivery.
- Added a macOS `deviceCheckGenerateToken` export that generates Apple DeviceCheck attestation tokens natively: it drives `DCDevice.generateToken` through raw Objective-C runtime FFI with a hand-built completion block literal and a bounded one-second wait, resolving `{ supported, tokenBase64, error, latencyMs }` to mirror the ChatGPT desktop app's `devicecheck.node` addon contract. Non-macOS builds resolve `supported: false` without touching the network.
- Added a genuine native desktop backend for computer use, bundled in the core addon on every published platform: macOS Quartz/CGEvent, Windows Win32/`SendInput`, and a pure-Rust Linux X11 backend (`x11rb` capture over the display socket, XTest input with keysym mapping) that links no GUI system libraries — so Linux x64/arm64, glibc and musl are all supported and headless hosts are unaffected. Wayland sessions work through XWayland. Execute batches enforce a 60-second native deadline (`DESKTOP_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`) and never emit input after it expires; unsupported pure-Wayland capture and out-of-XTest-range or negative-origin coordinate layouts fail closed.

### Fixed

- Fixed macOS computer screenshots taking roughly 30 seconds under Bun by replacing xcap's deprecated window-list capture with a bounded system capture path; direct screenshots now complete in under half a second on the verified host.

## [17.0.8] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added jsdiff-compatible native diff exports: `diffLines`, `diffWords`, `diffLineRuns`, and `structuredPatchHunks`.
- Added batch vector kernels for mnemopi recall paths: `cosineSimilarityPairs`, `vectorIndexTopK`, and `mmrRerankIndices`.

### Changed

- Updated diff functions (`diffLines`, `diffWords`, `diffLineRuns`, `structuredPatchHunks`) to process UTF-16 code units natively end to end via `Utf16String`, supporting ill-formed JS strings with unpaired surrogates without throwing or converting to UTF-8.

### Fixed

- Fixed a critical issue where the in-process `rm` builtin treated an empty path operand as the current working directory, causing `rm -rf ""` to recursively delete the current directory. Empty operands are now rejected, matching GNU `rm` behavior.

### Removed

- Removed unused `similar` crate dependency and dev-dependency on npm `diff`.

## [17.0.5] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added optional PTY start callbacks that report the spawned child PID before command completion.

## [17.0.3] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- Fixed `~` (tilde) not expanding for every element of a brace expansion in the bash tool, so `mkdir -p ~/project/{a,b}` now creates both `a` and `b` under `$HOME/project` instead of leaving a literal `~/project/b` in the working directory ([#5819](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/5819)).
- Fixed ANSI text wrapping to close and restore OSC 8 hyperlinks at physical line boundaries, preventing link targets from leaking into appended content ([#5885](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/5885)).

## [17.0.2] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where running `uv run --extra <package> pytest` bypassed native pytest minimization due to a wrapper parsing error.
- Fixed a bug where timed-out shell pipelines dropped captured output and could cause Windows hosts to terminate during teardown. (#5316)

## [17.0.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the pi-natives version sentinel emitting "reinstall to re-sync" when a long-lived process survives an in-place upgrade: the loader now detects that the resident addon exposes a *prior* release's sentinel and reports "omp was upgraded while this session was running — restart to pick up the new version (disk is already consistent)" instead of misdiagnosing it as a stale on-disk file ([#4812](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4812)).

## [17.0.0] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Fixed the in-process grep builtin to correctly handle escaped alternation (\|) in default and -G (GNU basic-regex) searches, while preserving the correct regex dialects for -E, -F, and -P.

## [16.5.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Windows PTY callers were forced through shell command re-quoting by supporting direct executable and argument launching.

## [16.4.6] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added an in-process `readlink` shell builtin (vendored from uutils coreutils 0.8.0), supporting `-f`/`-e`/`-m` canonicalization, `-n`/`-z` delimiters, and `-v`/`-q`/`-s` verbosity, with path operands resolved against the shell working directory.
- Added in-process shell builtins for `realpath`, `touch`, `stat`, `date`, `mktemp`, `seq`, `yes`, `printenv`, `ln`, `truncate`, `tac`, `nproc`, `uname`, `whoami`, and `hostname` (vendored from uutils coreutils 0.8.0), plus native `which` (shell PATH lookup) and `diff` (unified output, `-U`/`-q`/`-N`, binary detection, recursive directory compare) builtins. All resolve path operands against the shell working directory, read the shell's exported environment, and honor abort/timeout cancellation; `ln` is gated with the destructive set (`PI_DISABLE_UUTILS_DESTRUCTIVE`), and system-mutating modes (`date --set`, hostname setting) are disabled.

### Fixed

- Fixed `ast_edit` rejecting byte-identical duplicate replacements as "Overlapping replacements detected": multiple rewrite ops matching the same node with the same output now collapse into one deterministic edit (deduped in both the preview listing/counts and the apply pass), so only genuinely divergent overlaps error.

## [16.4.5] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added context-safe, in-process shell builtins for common utilities including base64, basename, dirname, cut, tee, tr, paste, comm, sed, xargs, jq, and the md5sum/sha/b2sum checksum family. These builtins run without spawning external binaries, support pipelines, respect shell-relative paths and environment variables, and honor abort/timeout cancellation.

## [16.4.4] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Fixed fuzzyFind tie-breaking logic to prefer shallower paths first, preventing deeply nested matches from ranking above shallow ones on score ties.
- Fixed macOS installation issues for pi-natives by statically linking PCRE2, removing the runtime dependency on Homebrew's dynamic libpcre2-8.0.dylib library.

## [16.4.3] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Optimized non-recursive glob patterns (e.g., `dir/*.json`) to prevent traversing entire subtrees, significantly improving performance and preventing timeouts when searching large directories.
- Fixed native filesystem searches (`glob`, `grep`, and AST search/edit) incorrectly excluding explicitly rooted directories due to ancestor ignore rules.

## [16.3.13] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Fixed unbounded memory growth in the native bash output bridge when a command produces output faster than the JS event loop consumes it: the shell streaming path now uses a bounded chunk queue with real backpressure (pipe readers park until the JS callback catches up, parking the child on its pipe) instead of buffering the entire surplus in memory. No output is dropped — the rolling tail view, `[raw output: artifact://…]` lossless capture, and byte accounting are unaffected ([#4078](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4078)).
- Fixed `readImageFromClipboard` on Windows failing with "could not be converted to the appropriate format" for screenshots taken by Qt-based tools such as PixPin and Snipaste. arboard hands their `CF_DIBV5` payload (`BI_RGB` plus an alpha mask, rewritten to `BI_BITFIELDS`) to a header-less BMP decode that mis-places the pixel offset for V4/V5 bitfield headers; the native reader now falls back to decoding the raw `CF_DIB` clipboard bytes directly, so image paste no longer depends on the PowerShell bridge. ([#3426](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/3426))
- Fixed OMP being killed outright (OOM on memory-capped hosts such as WSL) when an output-heavy bash command hit its timeout: the unbounded output-bridge backlog could grow by gigabytes before cancellation and starve the JS event loop far past the deadline; with the bounded backpressured bridge the run resolves at its deadline with flat memory ([#4866](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4866)).

## [16.3.12] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Fixed the native build script failing to locate the `@napi-rs/cli` `napi` binary on Windows because the `PATH` lookup joined entries with a Unix `:` separator instead of the platform delimiter (`path.delimiter`).
- Fixed a Windows regression where an abnormal `omp` exit or bash cancellation could `TerminateProcess` unrelated `pwsh.exe` / `powershell.exe` sessions (including other Cursor terminal tabs). `SpawnRegistry` stored only the raw pid of each brush-spawned child and re-opened it via `Process::from_pid` at cancellation time; between those two moments Windows could recycle a freed pid onto an unrelated PowerShell, and `signal_tree` then walked the wrong subtree via Toolhelp. The observer now pins a stable `Process` handle at spawn time — on Windows the open handle keeps the pid slot reserved, on Linux the pidfd carries identity, on macOS the `(pid, start_time)` triple detects impersonation — so cancellation can only reach children this run actually launched. The registry sweeps exited entries once the recorded set crosses a small threshold so a long bash loop of short external commands cannot pin one owned OS handle per historical spawn. ([#4605](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4605))

## [16.3.6] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Rewrote native `grep` directory search to stream while the tree is walked: a work-stealing parallel traversal feeds searchers directly, and content-mode match budgets now terminate the walk itself instead of only the search. Limited searches keep deterministic path-ordered first pages at every budget size via windowed commits, with oversized files still deferred behind normal-sized results.
- Faster filesystem walker: gitignore/ignore state is now derived from each directory's own listing instead of up to five per-directory stat probes, per-entry allocations were eliminated through pooled directory scratch buffers and reusable path builders, and a new parallel unordered file-candidate walk API backs full-scan grep.
- Concurrent `grep` calls are no longer serialized against each other, searchers are reused per worker instead of rebuilt per file, and non-multiline patterns opt into grep-regex's line-terminator fast path with a compatibility fallback.

## [16.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added `workingDir` to `ShellRunResult` to allow hosts to synchronize the session's current working directory without executing a hidden probe command.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where panics in native worker tasks (such as grep, AST parsing, globbing, workspace listing, HTML-to-markdown conversion, fuzzy finding, and clipboard image reading) would abort the host process instead of properly rejecting the returned JavaScript Promise.
- Fixed a crash on Windows under low memory or commit charge conditions when spawning worker threads for token counting or sorting operations.

## [16.2.11] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Fixed high memory usage in native `astGrep` and `astMatch` by retaining only the requested page window of match payloads during broad searches while preserving exact totals.

## [16.2.10] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added a platform-native no-ignore filesystem traversal path for `glob`/`grep` scans, using `getattrlistbulk` on macOS, `getdents64`/`statx` on Linux, and `NtQueryDirectoryFile` with `FileIdFullDirectoryInformation` on Windows while preserving the existing `WalkBuilder` path for gitignore-aware scans.

## [16.2.7] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added embedded Silver TrueType font rendering support to `renderSnapcompactPng`, featuring automatic per-glyph fallback for missing bitmap characters and anti-aliased scaling for East Asian wide code points.
- Added the `snapcompactSupportedChars` function to check font capability for specific characters.

## [16.2.5] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Fixed the in-process `grep` builtin rejecting GNU-grep's `--color`/`--colour` (with or without `=WHEN`) and `--version` flags. The shadowing rejection broke bash's near-universal `alias grep='grep --color=auto'`, causing bare `grep` in any pipeline to fail with exit 2. The builtin now accepts and ignores `--color[=WHEN]` (its output goes through in-process file descriptors, never a TTY, so ANSI injection would corrupt downstream consumers) and reports its version through the context streams ([#3755](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/3755)).

## [16.2.4] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash in the in-process `tail` builtin where the host process would abort with a `BrokenPipe` panic if the stdout consumer closed the pipe early.

## [16.1.23] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added Nix and Mermaid syntax highlighting support to `highlightCode`/`supportsLanguage` via vendored `Nix.sublime-syntax` and `Mermaid.sublime-syntax` definitions plus `nix`, `mermaid`, and `mmd` aliases.
- Added in-process [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils)-backed shell builtins to the embedded brush `Shell`: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and `mv`. These vendored + patched utilities run inside the shell process (no `fork`/`exec`), resolve path operands against the shell working directory, route stdio through the command's (possibly piped/redirected) file descriptors, read the shell's exported environment, and honor abort/timeout cancellation (a blocked `stdin` read unwinds cleanly). `grep` is built on the ripgrep `grep-*` crates and `find` on `uutils/findutils`; the rest are pinned to `uutils/coreutils` 0.8.0 (matching the bundled `uucore`). Registration is gated: set `PI_DISABLE_UUTILS_BUILTINS` to fall back to the system binaries for the whole set, or `PI_DISABLE_UUTILS_DESTRUCTIVE` / `PI_DISABLE_RM_BUILTIN` / `PI_DISABLE_MV_BUILTIN` to disable only the destructive `rm`/`mv` shadows.

## [16.1.17] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Added `setHangulCompatJamoWidthOverride(value)` to override the Hangul Compatibility Jamo (U+3131..U+318E) display width at runtime via a process-global atomic, instead of relying solely on the compile-time `cfg!(target_os = "macos")` heuristic. The actual width is decided by the client terminal (not the host OS), so the TUI resolves it from the terminal identity and pushes the result here. Encoding: `0` = platform default (macOS narrow, otherwise UAX#11), `1` = narrow (1 cell), `2` = wide (2 cells), `3` = Unicode width (no correction). The leaf width helpers read this override, so no width/slice/truncate/wrap signatures change.

## [16.1.15] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added `Shell.liveBackgroundJobCount()` reporting the number of live external background jobs (`&`/`nohup` children) on a persistent session, reaping completed jobs first via a silent `poll()`. Lets the host retain a shell whose background process is still running instead of dropping it (which would SIGKILL the child via kill-on-drop).

### Fixed

- Fixed `pi_natives` failing to load in Bun worker threads on macOS x64 when the host built only the `modern` (AVX2) variant. The runtime detector's `child_process.spawnSync("sysctl", …)` returned null from the worker even though the build-time detector succeeded in the parent, so `loadNative()` resolved `variant=baseline` and searched a file list that excluded the on-disk `pi_natives.darwin-x64-modern.node`. Resolution now prefers `Bun.spawnSync`, tries `/usr/sbin/sysctl` before bare `sysctl`, and caches the first context's verdict via a private env key so child workers and subprocesses inherit it instead of re-detecting ([#3238](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/3238)).

## [16.1.14] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Enabled full Julia syntax highlighting support in highlightCode

## [16.1.12] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added Julia syntax highlighting to `highlightCode`/`supportsLanguage` via a vendored `Julia.sublime-syntax` folded into syntect's default set (`jl`/`julia` aliases); syntect ships no Julia grammar.

## [16.1.8] - 2026-06-20

### Breaking Changes

- Changed renderSnapcompactPng to return a promise instead of a string value

### Fixed

- Fixed directory `grep` continuing to walk large trees after the requested content match budget had already been satisfied, which could make broad coding-agent searches time out before returning the first page of matches ([#2738](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2738)).

## [16.0.11] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Fixed native shell execution reporting `pi-natives:command: syntax error at end of input` for a valid `&&`/`;` chain whose later pipeline stage is a compound command, e.g. `echo x && git log | while read h; do …; done | head`. The output minimizer's segmented-chain runner rebuilds each chain segment from the brush-parser AST via `pipeline.to_string()` and re-executes that string, but `simple_segment` only validated the *first* pipeline stage — so a compound later stage (`while`/`for`/`if`/subshell) was re-serialized without its terminator (`Display` drops it) and re-run as broken shell. `simple_segment` now requires every stage to be a `Display`-safe simple command, and — closing the recurring class of brush `Display` round-trip divergences (here-doc close-tag quoting, multi-byte char/byte offsets) at its root — each reconstructed segment is re-parsed and must match the original pipeline shape before the chain runner executes it; any divergence runs the command whole via the unsegmented path instead of corrupting it.

## [16.0.7] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added Fortran support to the AST tooling, including file/alias resolution.

## [16.0.6] - 2026-06-18

### Removed

- Removed the `cache` option from `GrepOptions`

## [16.0.4] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Fixed `summarizeCode` BFS unfold aborting the entire pass when it hit an oversized, un-unfoldable leaf span (e.g. an HTML `<style>` raw-text block, an embedded blob, or a minified line) whose only unfold candidate is its whole body. The overflow check used to `break` the breadth-first loop, so any large leaf encountered before its siblings starved the rest of the tree — an HTML page summarized to `<style> ... </style>` plus `<div class="page"> ... </div>`, collapsing the document body into one dead `...`. An overflowing span is now skipped (left folded, its subtree unexplored) and the BFS keeps unfolding the remaining queued siblings, so structured siblings like the `<body>` DOM are revealed up to `unfoldLimit` while the oversized leaf stays folded.

## [16.0.2] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added Emacs Lisp (`.el`, `.emacs`, `emacs-lisp`/`elisp`) support to native tree-sitter language inference, enabling astGrep/astEdit, summarizeCode, and blockRangeAt on Emacs Lisp source.

## [16.0.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Fixed shipped Linux native addons failing to load with `version 'GLIBC_2.39' not found` on distributions older than Ubuntu 24.04. After native builds moved onto the Ubuntu 24.04 (glibc 2.39) self-hosted runner, the x64 addon was a plain host build that linked the runner's glibc and the arm64 cross-build floated up to GLIBC_2.30; the `linux-x64` (baseline + modern) and `linux-arm64` addons are now built through `cargo-zigbuild` against a pinned glibc 2.17 floor, restoring portability to any glibc ≥ 2.17 (CentOS 7 / Ubuntu 14.04 era).
- Fixed Linux native builds hard-failing when `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` points at an unavailable shared cache backend. The native build script now retries the `napi` build once without the sccache wrapper after a cache-storage startup failure, so install smoke tests and local fallback builds can proceed while preserving the cached fast path when the backend is healthy.
- Fixed shell cancellation cleanup failing to reap child processes inside containers whose guest kernel was built without `CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN` (e.g. some Kata/microVM guests): the Linux descendant walk relied solely on `/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children`, which does not exist there, so `children()` / `live_descendants()` returned empty and termination waves never reached the children. It now falls back to scanning `/proc` and grouping by parent pid (the primitive the macOS path already uses) when no `children` file is readable, keeping the cheap per-task fast path on kernels that support it.

## [15.13.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Fixed `pi-natives` deadlocking at addon load (`dlopen` hang) on some Linux hosts. The load-time Tokio runtime install added in 15.12.6 ran inside `#[module_init]`, which executes while the dynamic-loader lock is held; building the multi-thread runtime there eagerly spawns worker threads, and a fresh worker blocking to acquire the loader lock the init thread still owns deadlocks the whole load (every native consumer hangs at startup). The runtime is now built from an exported `__ompInstallTokioRuntime` that the JS loader calls once, immediately after `dlopen` returns and before any async native runs; `#[module_init]` only installs the crash handler. napi-rs materializes its runtime lazily on first async use (`RT` is a `LazyLock`) and `create_custom_tokio_runtime` only records the runtime, so the post-load install is still adopted — preserving the Windows commit-limit thread probing/back-off from 15.12.6 without spawning under the loader lock.
- Fixed `blockRangeAt` (and thus the edit tool's `replace block` / `delete block` / `insert after block` ops) returning no block for a construct whose opening line follows a blank line — most visibly in Swift, where `replace block` on a SwiftUI `var body: some View {` (or any statement/declaration after a blank line) failed with "could not resolve a syntactic block… (unsupported language, blank/closer line, or parse error)". tree-sitter-swift inserts a zero-width separator node at the start of a statement that follows a blank line; the resolver queried the first content column with a zero-width point range, which `ts_node_named_descendant_for_point_range` absorbs into that invisible node and bubbles back up to the enclosing body (or the file root), so no block was found. The query now spans the first content character (a one-column-wide range) so it skips zero-width nodes and descends into the node that actually begins on the line.
- Fixed native shell execution reporting `unterminated here document sequence` for a multi-command line that contains a here-doc with a quoted or escaped delimiter (`<<'TAG'`, `<<"TAG"`, `<<\TAG`) followed by another command (e.g. a `sqlite3 … <<'SQL' … SQL` query followed by an `echo`/second command). The output minimizer's segmented-chain runner rebuilds each `&&`/`;`/newline segment from the brush-parser AST via `pipeline.to_string()`, and that `Display` impl re-emits a quoted/escaped here-doc's *closing* delimiter with its quotes intact (`'SQL'` instead of the required bare `SQL`) — an invalid close tag that the re-run segment never matches. Here-doc-bearing pipelines are now ineligible for segmentation, so the command runs whole via the unsegmented path (where the executor parses it correctly); a lone here-doc was unaffected because it was never segmented.
- Fixed native addon loading leaving stale `~/.omp/natives/<version>` cache directories behind after updates; successful loads now remove older version directories best-effort.
- Fixed Linux source-built native addons hanging during package import by keeping the Windows-only Tokio worker probe out of non-Windows module initialization ([#2553](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2553)).
- Fixed `pi-iso` Windows clippy failures in symlink placeholder metadata, block-clone path resolution, and readonly cleanup handling ([#2379](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/2379) by [@oldschoola](https://github.com/oldschoola)).

## [15.12.6] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Fixed `pi-natives` aborting the whole process at addon load on memory-constrained Windows hosts (`OS can't spawn worker thread`, typically OS error 1455 — pagefile/commit limit). napi-rs builds its own Tokio runtime with one eagerly-spawned worker per CPU, and that spawn *panics* rather than erroring, so under `panic = "abort"` the failure was uncatchable. The addon now installs its own runtime at load: it probes how many threads the OS will actually grant (starting from the Tokio default, clamped to a small ceiling since CPU-heavy native work runs on libuv/Rayon and Tokio's separate blocking pool, not the scheduler workers), sizes the multi-thread runtime to the probed count, and falls back to a current-thread runtime if not even one worker can be spawned — no panic on any path.

## [15.12.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Fixed native shell execution rejecting quoted heredocs whose closing delimiter is the final line without a trailing newline, matching bash paste-run snippets.

## [15.11.7] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added the X.org misc `6x12` and `8x13` BDF fonts (public domain, vendored in `crates/pi-natives/src/fonts/`) to `renderSnapcompactPng`, alongside two new options for the snapcompact eval-winner shapes: `stretch: false` renders glyphs at natural size on the requested cell box while keeping the 4-bit indexed encoder (e.g. 8x13 glyphs on an 8x16 pitch, the "8on16" shapes), and `columns: 2` flows pre-wrapped newline-separated lines down two newspaper columns with a 3-cell gutter (the "doc" shapes); in doc mode sentence hues also advance across a terminator followed by a newline
- Added a line-break marker to `renderSnapcompactPng`: `U+2588` (FULL BLOCK) fills its entire cell box with pitch-black ink in both grid and doc layouts, ignoring the sentence hue and dim state, and counts as a sentence boundary after a `.`/`!`/`?` terminator

### Changed

- `renderSnapcompactPng` now clips the frame height to the text: the PNG stays `size` pixels wide but is only `usedRows * lineRepeat * cellHeight` tall (dim toggles are zero-width; doc layout counts `\n`-separated lines), so a partially filled frame no longer pads to a full square of blank rows
- `renderSnapcompactPng` indexed frames now narrow the palette to the colors actually printed and pick the matching bit depth (plain `bw` 1-bit, dim/banded 2-bit, sentence hues up to 4-bit), and both encode paths moved from `Balanced` to `High` deflate: `8on16-bw` frames shrink ~35%, `6x12-dim` ~10%, sentence-hue doc frames ~9% — pure PNG, no decoder-side changes (lossless WebP was measured at only ~8% beyond this and rejected for provider-compatibility risk)

## [15.11.4] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Fixed `blockRangeAt` (and thus the edit tool's `replace block` / `insert after block` ops) failing on extensionless shell rc/profile files. `Path::extension` returns `None` for both bare (`zshrc`) and dotfile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`) forms, so language inference fell through to "unrecognized" and block resolution was permanently unresolvable on those files — an agent retrying the block op would loop on the same error. Known shell rc/profile basenames (`zshrc`/`zshenv`/`zprofile`/`zlogin`/`zlogout`/`bashrc`/`bash_profile`/`bash_login`/`bash_logout`/`bash_aliases`/`profile`/`kshrc`/`mkshrc`/`shrc`, with or without a leading dot) now resolve to the bash grammar.

## [15.11.0] - 2026-06-10

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `renderSnapcompactPng(text, options)` to return a base64-encoded PNG `string` instead of a `Uint8Array`

### Added

- Added dim-span ink toggles to `renderSnapcompactPng`: `U+000E`/`U+000F` in the input switch to a dim gray ink (palette index 9) and back without occupying a glyph cell, letting callers visually de-emphasize spans such as archived tool output
- Added `renderSnapcompactPng(text, options)`: rasterizes pre-normalized text onto a square PNG in an eval-validated snapcompact shape. Options select the bundled font (`5x8` X.org BDF or `8x8` unscii-8, both public domain, shipped in `crates/pi-natives/src/fonts/`), the ink variant (`sent` six-hue sentence cycling or `bw` black), line repetition (each text line printed N times, copies on a pale highlight band), and a target cell size — cells differing from the font's natural cell render via Lanczos3 stretch into an anti-aliased RGB frame (e.g. the OpenAI-optimal 6x6 unscii shape); native-cell shapes encode as 4-bit indexed PNG. Replaces the JS rasterizer/PNG writer previously in `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core`.

## [15.10.12] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added deterministic shell-output minimization to the native shell pipeline, including opt-in per-command rewrite telemetry surfaced through `executeShell().minimized` for callers that want compact inline output plus a separately persisted original capture.

### Fixed

- Fixed native crash-log directory resolution diverging from the JS logger when `PI_CONFIG_DIR` is absolute: the config root now mirrors `path.join(homedir, PI_CONFIG_DIR)` semantics (absolute values re-rooted under `$HOME`, `.`/`..` components normalized), and an empty `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` no longer disables XDG state-dir resolution.
- Fixed shell-output minimization condensing `pyright`/`basedpyright` `--outputjson` runs into a diagnostics summary; machine-readable JSON output now passes through untouched.
- Fixed `pi-natives` aborting Bun on Windows with `memory allocation of N bytes failed` and no backtrace whenever the native cdylib hit a Rust panic or out-of-memory condition. The release profile uses `panic = "abort"`, so neither default handler emitted any context — Bun received only the bare message and tore down the TUI session before flushing. Module load now installs `std::panic::set_hook` and `std::alloc::set_alloc_error_hook` via `#[napi::module_init]`; both hooks capture `Backtrace::force_capture()` (so it works without `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`) and write a structured report — pid, thread, size/alignment for OOM, source location and message for panics, full backtrace — to the same logs directory the JS logger uses (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/omp/logs/` on Linux/macOS when the user has migrated to XDG and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` isn't customized, otherwise `~/.omp/logs/`) and to stderr before the host process exits. The OOM hook prints the canonical allocation-failure line before any allocation-prone diagnostics and aborts immediately on re-entry, so real process-wide OOM still surfaces the fallback message instead of recursing in the report path ([#2211](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2211)).

## [15.10.11] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added a `maxCountPerFile` option to `grep` that caps how many matches a single file may contribute, so one hot file can no longer exhaust the global `maxCount` budget in path order and starve every file sorted after it out of the result set entirely.
- Added `PI_DEBUG_STARTUP` streaming markers to the addon loader (`native:loadNative:start`, `native:extractEmbeddedAddon:start`, `native:require:<file>`, `native:loadNative:done`), written with synchronous stderr writes so a hang inside first-run extraction or `dlopen()` — which blocks the event loop and defeats any timer-based diagnostics — still leaves the failing step as the last marker on stderr.
- Added a `skippedOversized` count to `GrepResult`: directory walks now report how many files were silently skipped for exceeding the 4MB per-file grep limit (previously they vanished without a trace, letting callers conclude a symbol does not exist).

### Changed

- Parallelized the mtime-ranked `glob()` walk (the path OMP `find` always takes): per-thread bounded top-N heaps replace the single-threaded full-stat traversal, so large trees rank in a fraction of the wall clock while keeping the deterministic mtime-desc/path ordering and bounded memory.

### Fixed

- Fixed cross-line grep being a silent no-op on real files: `multiline` set the `(?m)` flag on the regex matcher but never enabled `multi_line` on the `Searcher`, which stayed line-oriented, so any pattern spanning a `\n` returned zero matches with no error.

## [15.10.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added the `enclosingBlockBoundaries` native API (with `EnclosingBoundaryOptions` and `LineRange` types) that returns, for a set of visible line ranges, the off-window boundary lines of every multi-line tree-sitter node whose span crosses the window — the closer when an opener is shown and the opener when a closer is shown. Covers brace and indentation languages (Python) via real syntactic spans; returns `null` for unrecognized languages or sources with syntax errors so callers can fall back to a lexical scan.
- Added a `nohup` shell builtin to the embedded `pi_shell`, shadowing the external `/usr/bin/nohup`. It runs its operand command and propagates that command's exit status (and reports `missing operand` / exit 125 with no operand), but deliberately does **not** mask `SIGHUP` or detach the child into a new session the way real `nohup` does. Agents reach for `nohup … &` assuming the shell is one-shot; in this persistent embedded shell that assumption is wrong and the only effect of real `nohup` was to leak background processes that outlived the host. The builtin keeps such commands as ordinary descendants so they are reaped with the host instead of surviving as orphans.

## [15.10.2] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added the `super` modifier to `matchesKey` / `parseKey` / `parseKittySequence`. Key identifiers may now include `super+` (anywhere in the modifier prefix), and Kitty CSI-u sequences whose modifier mask contains the super bit (8) — e.g. Ghostty's macOS Option+Backspace `ESC [127;11u` — are now recognised instead of dropped ([#2064](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2064)).

### Fixed

- Fixed the native `copyToClipboard` leaving the X11 clipboard empty on Linux even while the process kept running. arboard answers clipboard `SelectionRequest`s from a background thread that lives only as long as a `Clipboard` instance exists, and the binding dropped its transient `Clipboard` immediately after `set_text` — tearing that thread down so the selection lost its owner and the clipboard read back empty (matching the `returned ok but clipboard=''` symptom). The Linux path now holds a single `Clipboard` for the lifetime of the process so the owner thread keeps serving, with no `xclip`/`wl-copy` subprocess; macOS/Windows keep the transient write on the calling thread ([#2075](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2075)).

## [15.10.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Fixed `applyBashFixups` corrupting commands that contain multi-byte UTF-8 before a trailing `| head`/`| tail` (or `2>&1`). `brush-parser` reports source positions as Unicode-scalar (char) offsets, but `pi_shell::fixup` sliced the command `&str` by those numbers as if they were byte offsets, so each multi-byte char (e.g. `✓`/`×` in a `grep -E` pattern) shifted the cut earlier and left a mangled command — e.g. `… |✓|×|XCTAssert" | tail -80` became `… |✓|×-80`, orphaning the closing quote and making the shell reject the whole pipeline with `unterminated double quote`. Positions are now translated to byte offsets before slicing.

## [15.9.0] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Bounded sorted `glob()` scans to `maxResults` during uncached traversal and emitted `onMatch` callbacks only for entries admitted to the bounded top-`maxResults` heap so broad OMP `find` progress and timeout partials stay consistent with the returned mtime-ranked set while keeping parent-process memory bounded ([#1761](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1761)).
- Fixed `wrapTextWithAnsi` hanging (infinite loop) on text containing a BEL-terminated string escape — DCS/SOS/PM/APC (`ESC P`/`ESC X`/`ESC ^`/`ESC _`) closed by `BEL` instead of `ST`. `ansi_seq_len_u16` only accepted the `ST` (`ESC \`) terminator for these (OSC already accepted both), so a BEL-terminated APC such as the TUI cursor marker (`ESC _ pi:c BEL`) was left unclassified: it was miscounted as visible width and `break_long_word`'s non-ESC scan could not advance past the `ESC`, spinning forever. The terminator set now matches OSC (ST **or** BEL), and `break_long_word` defensively emits and steps over any escape it cannot classify so a malformed/unknown sequence can never wedge the wrap loop.

## [15.7.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added `blockRangeAt` native API along with `BlockRange` and `BlockRangeOptions` types to return the 1-indexed line span of the outermost tree-sitter node beginning on a given line

### Fixed

- Fixed an interactive shell inside a **pipeline** (`zsh -i ... | awk`, `time zsh -i | cat`, etc.) suspending the embedded host with `suspended (tty input)`. The earlier embedded-host fix `setsid`-detached external children so they could not seize the host's controlling tty, but carved pipeline stages out because a later stage that `setpgid`-joined a detached leader failed with EPERM — leaving every pipeline stage in the host session, where an interactive child opened `/dev/tty`, `tcsetpgrp`'d itself to the foreground, and stopped the host (OMP) on its next tty read. `pi_shell` now detaches pipeline stages too: `child_session_action` returns `DetachSession` for any non-terminal-stdin child regardless of pipeline membership, and `execute_external_command` skips `process_group(...)` entirely for detached children so no cross-session `setpgid` is attempted. Pipeline stages no longer share one process group, which the embedded host does not rely on (cancellation walks the descendant tree and pipes are session-independent).

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Changed npm publishing to ship `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives` as a small core loader package plus per-platform optional dependency leaf packages, so installs fetch only the host platform's native addon instead of every supported `.node` binary.

## [15.5.10] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Fixed background bash jobs pinning the JS main thread at ~200% CPU when the child process emits output in many tiny writes (printf-style progress, llama-cli token streams). `pi_shell`'s pipe reader forwarded every chunk through a separate `ThreadsafeFunction::call` per kernel `read(2)`, so a chatty child produced millions of cross-thread napi callbacks that the JS main thread had to drain serially — even after the child exited, the queue kept the process saturated for seconds. The bridge now greedily coalesces every chunk already in the mpsc queue into a single batched call (capped at 64 KiB) before crossing into JS, collapsing 1-byte writes into one napi dispatch and bringing the steady-state callback rate back to the JS event-loop's throughput.

## [15.5.9] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Changed native addon extraction to skip re-extracting cached `.node` files when their size already matches embedded archive metadata
- Changed standalone binaries to embed native addons as a compressed tarball and unpack them into the versioned native cache on first run instead of embedding each `.node` file uncompressed.

### Fixed

- Fixed CI native addon builds retaining ELF debug and symbol sections in release artifacts; stripped builds are now verified to reject `.debug_*`, `.zdebug_*`, `.symtab`, and `.strtab` sections.

### Security

- Hardened embedded addon archive extraction by rejecting unsafe entry names and non-file archive entries before writing binaries to disk

## [15.5.4] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added `Hashline` class with methods to format headers, parse/apply hashline edits, split inputs, compute diffs, generate previews, and recover from stale hashes
- Added `HashlineChunker` class to stream UTF-8 text into numbered hashline chunks incrementally
- Added `HashlineCursorKind`, `HashlineEditKind`, and `HashlineTokenKind` exports for hashline cursor/edit/token discrimination
- Added `unfoldUntilLines` and `unfoldLimitLines` options to `SummaryOptions` to control BFS unfold visibility with an optional hard cap

## [15.5.0] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed bash heredocs (`<<`) and here-strings (`<<<`) deadlocking the shell on Windows past ~4 KiB and on macOS past 16-64 KiB. `brush_core::interp::setup_open_file_with_contents` wrote the entire body into an anonymous pipe synchronously before handing the reader to the next command; once the body exceeded the OS pipe buffer the writer blocked forever and the `bash` tool timed out at the hard 305 s ceiling without ever launching the consumer. The Linux fast path still uses `F_SETPIPE_SZ` to grow the pipe in-place; every other OS-threaded platform (and Linux bodies above `pipe-max-size`) now decouples the write onto a fire-and-forget thread that terminates naturally on drain or `BrokenPipe`; no-thread targets keep the upstream synchronous path so heredocs do not fail at thread spawn.

## [15.3.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Fixed `matchesKey` claiming `ctrl+m`/`ctrl+j`/`ctrl+i`/`ctrl+h`/`ctrl+[` for the single bytes terminals emit for Enter/Tab/Backspace/Escape in legacy mode. Pressing Enter no longer triggers a `ctrl+m` binding; the named keys now own those bytes and the colliding `ctrl+<letter>` combinations only match when the terminal disambiguates via the Kitty keyboard protocol or `modifyOtherKeys`. The same gate now also applies to `ctrl+alt+<letter>` legacy `ESC + <ctrl-char>` sequences (e.g. `\x1b\r` is Alt+Enter, not Ctrl+Alt+M). ([#1354](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1354))

## [15.0.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added a per-release version sentinel napi export (`__piNativesV{major}_{minor}_{patch}`). The Rust `js_name` is bumped in lock-step with the package version by `scripts/release.ts`; the JS loader computes the expected name from `package.json#version` and throws an actionable error when the on-disk `.node` doesn't expose it. This converts the silent `<sym> is not a function` crash from a stale addon into a load-time failure pointing at the real fix.
- Added `applyBashFixups(command)` — a synchronous brush-parser-driven rewrite that strips trailing `| head|tail …`, redundant `2>&1`, and the `|&` shorthand from top-level pipelines, returning `{ command, stripped }`. Replaces the hand-rolled top-level mask scanner in `pi-coding-agent`; tokenization, quoting, heredocs, command substitution, and nested compound commands are now handled by the real shell AST instead of regex/character-walking. Lives in `pi_shell::fixup` on the Rust side.

### Fixed

- Fixed `<sym> is not a function` crashes on Windows after `bun install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` updates while an `omp` process was running. Bun cannot overwrite a locked `node_modules/@oh-my-pi/pi-natives/native/pi_natives.win32-x64.node` and silently keeps the old binary alongside the new ESM wrapper, so the next launch loads mismatched code. The loader now mirrors the addon into `~/.omp/natives/<version>/` on Windows npm installs and prefers that copy at load time — each version gets its own filesystem path, so future updates land in `node_modules` unchallenged. The new version sentinel detects any remaining drift up front.
- Fixed `$env:NAME` PowerShell references being collapsed to `:NAME` when brush forwarded a command to a PowerShell (or any) subprocess. `pi-shell` now defines `env=$env` as a non-exported global on every brush session so the bash parameter expansion of `$env` yields the literal `$env`, leaving `$env:NAME` intact. User-driven assignments (`env=prod`) push their own command-scope binding and shadow the fallback, preserving the bash POSIX contract. ([#1079](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1079))

## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14

### Breaking Changes

- Raised the minimum required Bun runtime version to >=1.3.14
- Removed `PhotonImage` class, `ImageFormat` enum, and `SamplingFilter` enum from native exports. General-purpose image decode/resize/encode now uses [`Bun.Image`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/image), which ships in Bun 1.3.14+ with statically-linked libjpeg-turbo, libspng, and libwebp plus SIMD geometry kernels — same operations, zero native-addon footprint. `encodeSixel` stays (no Bun equivalent for the SIXEL terminal protocol).
- Removed `webp` Rust workspace dependency along with `PhotonImage`'s WebP encoder.

## [14.9.9] - 2026-05-12

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `projfsOverlayProbe`, `projfsOverlayStart`, and `projfsOverlayStop` overlays APIs and `ProjfsOverlayProbeResult` type from the public natives interface

### Added

- Added unified isolation APIs `isoBackend`, `isoProbe`, `isoResolve`, `isoStart`, `isoStop`, `isoDiff`, and `isoIsUnavailableError` for selecting, probing, resolving, starting, stopping, and diffing isolated filesystems
- Added `IsoBackendKind`, `IsoChangeKind`, `IsoDiff`, `IsoFileChange`, `IsoProbeResult`, and `IsoResolveResult` type exports to describe isolation backend capabilities and diff outcomes

### Changed

- Changed `native` exports to remove the platform-specific ProjFS-only overlay surface in favor of generic isolation controls

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Fixed shell cancellation occasionally killing the harness. The `pi_shell` descendant tracker harvested every descendant's `pgid` into the kill set, so any subprocess that inherited the harness's pgid (any helper spawned via APIs that do not call `setpgid` — sibling LSP/MCP processes, etc.) dragged `harness.pgid` into the list and the follow-up `kill(-harness.pgid, SIGTERM)` terminated the harness alongside the targets. The classifier now only adopts a `pgid` when its leader is itself one of the new descendants, and `kill_process_group` refuses the harness's own process group as a last-line defense.
- Fixed macOS process-tree termination silently doing nothing. The descendant walk relied on `proc_listchildpids`, which on recent darwin kernels (25.4+) returns no entries when a process queries its own children, so `Process::descendants` came back empty and tree-kill cleanup never reached grandchildren. The walk now builds a one-shot `ppid → [pid]` map from `proc_listallpids` + `proc_pidinfo`, matching the approach already used by `find_by_path` and the Windows Toolhelp path.

### Changed

- Removed the 20 Hz background descendant tracker that scanned the harness's process tree for the entire lifetime of every shell command. Cancellation now does a small rescan-and-signal loop on demand (up to three waves — SIGTERM, then SIGKILL, then SIGKILL — with early exit as soon as no descendants remain). The previous tracker existed to pin process identities against PID reuse races, but `Process::from_pid` already pins identity by kernel start time / pidfd, so the constant scanning paid for nothing and added meaningful syscall load on macOS where each scan now does `proc_listallpids` + `proc_pidinfo` per pid.

## [14.9.3] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added `idle`, `system`, and `user` options to `MacOSPowerAssertion` so callers can request specific macOS sleep-prevention modes (`caffeinate -i`, `-s`, and `-u`) in addition to the existing `display` option
- Added support for combining multiple macOS power assertion flags in a single `MacOSPowerAssertion` handle

### Changed

- Changed `MacOSPowerAssertion.stop()` documentation to indicate it releases all held assertions and is safe to call repeatedly as a no-op

## [14.9.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added `listWorkspace`, a native single-pass workspace walker that returns bounded tree entries and AGENTS.md directory-context candidates together.

## [14.7.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added `size` property to `GlobMatch` for regular files to expose their byte size

### Changed

- Sped up native `grep` files-with-matches searches by stopping after the first match per file, reading small files without mmap overhead, and relying on grep-searcher binary detection instead of a separate full-file NUL scan.

### Fixed

- Fixed native `grep` `filesWithMatches` mode so `totalMatches` reports the number of matching files rather than line-match totals
- Fixed native `grep` count-mode limits applying to files instead of matches, and restored timeout/abort cancellation checks for small native filesystem scans.

## [14.7.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Simplified native build profile suffix formatting without changing `local` and `ci` values
- Changed the native build output behavior to avoid setting an isolated Cargo target directory automatically

### Removed

- Removed the host Zig CPU contract wrapper (`zig-safe-wrapper.ts`) and its `ZIG`/`PI_NATIVE_REAL_ZIG`/`PI_NATIVE_ZIG_TARGET`/`PI_NATIVE_ZIG_CPU` env handling, since the `zlob` Rust dependency that required Zig is gone
- Removed the `ci-release-verify-natives` script and its AVX-512 marker scan from the release pipeline

## [14.5.12] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `waitForExit` to accept a single options object instead of a numeric timeout argument

### Added

## [14.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Added `text` to `MinimizerResult` so consumers can replace rewritten output with the minimized replacement text
- Added `settingsHash` to `MinimizerOptions` to verify the minimizer `settingsPath` contents against a xxHash64 digest before applying them
- Added `minimized` output telemetry via `MinimizerResult` on `ShellExecuteResult` and `ShellRunResult`, exposing the applied minimizer filter and original/minimized byte counts when output is rewritten
- Added a new `minimizer` option to `ShellExecuteOptions` and `ShellOptions` to configure per-command output minimization
- Added the `MinimizerOptions` API with controls for enabling minimization, overriding settings via `settingsPath`, allow/deny lists (`only`, `except`), and `maxCaptureBytes` capture limits

### Changed

- Changed the shell output minimizer to more aggressively compact successful test runs, git output, large listings, grep/find results, source reads, and dependency manifests
- Changed compound and piped shell commands to bypass output minimization entirely, keeping minimization limited to eligible whole-command output after the command exits

### Fixed

- Fixed chunk edit batches so later operations can reuse an initially validated checksum after an earlier operation changes that same chunk

### Removed

- Removed `PI_DEV` loader diagnostic env var and associated console logging in the native addon loader

### Security

- Added trust-gated loading for minimizer settings by requiring a matching `settingsHash` before accepting a settings file

## [14.2.0] - 2026-04-23
