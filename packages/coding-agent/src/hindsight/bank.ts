/**
 * Bank ID derivation, project-tag scoping, and first-use bank setup.
 *
 * Three scoping modes (`HindsightConfig.scoping`):
 *   - `global`              — single shared bank, no per-project filter.
 *   - `per-project`         — one bank per cwd basename, hard isolation.
 *   - `per-project-tagged`  — single shared bank, retains carry a `project:<name>`
 *                              tag and recall filters on it but still surfaces
 *                              untagged ("global") memories alongside.
 *
 * The base bank id is `bankIdPrefix-bankId` (default `omp`). Per-project mode
 * appends `-<project>`; tagged mode leaves the bank untouched and uses tags.
 *
 * Bank existence is idempotent at module level — a banksSet keeps track of
 * banks we've already PUT so each session boundary doesn't fire a fresh
 * `createBank` call. The PUT is idempotent server-side, so re-firing on a hot
 * path would only burn round-trips. Failures are swallowed: missing the
 * mission patch is an optimisation, but the bank ITSELF must exist before
 * mental-model bootstrap or the first retain, otherwise the very first POST
 * lands against a missing bank.

 * tags literally, so a checkout at `.../General` would otherwise retain into a
 * `project:General` scope that never meets the `project:general` scope every
 * other client of the same bank reads and writes.
 *
