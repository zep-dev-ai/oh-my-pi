 * Cross-process contract for the broker-owned LSP mux daemon.

 * each concurrent OMP link its own language-server process, then retains idle
 * processes briefly for reuse by later links. The link speaks plain
 * Content-Length-framed LSP JSON-RPC after a one-request handshake
 * ({@link MUX_CONNECT_METHOD}); everything below is shared by the worker
 * entry (`server.ts`), the client connector (`daemon.ts`), and tests.
