# Settings

`omp` resolves settings from built-in defaults, a persistent global config file, optional project-local config, one-shot CLI overlays, and in-memory runtime overrides. Reach for project settings when one repository needs a different provider set, model role, tool policy, memory backend, or UI behavior than your global defaults — without touching your machine-wide configuration.

Settings are stored as plain YAML mappings. Every key, its type, default, and enum values come from the settings schema. `omp config` exposes the complete schema; the interactive `/settings` panel exposes the schema entries that have UI metadata.

## Where settings live

| Scope             | Path                                                  | Read behavior                                                                                                                            | Write behavior                                                                                                                                                                   |

`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` relocates the `~/.omp/agent` base directory. When it is set, the global `config.yml`, the auth store (`agent.db`), and everything else under the agent directory move with it. Use `omp config path` to print the active agent directory.

Native project settings are intentionally scoped to the process working directory's `.omp/` folder — settings discovery does **not** walk ancestor directories looking for the nearest `.omp/`. Other discovery providers (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode) can also contribute project-level settings from their own files; those are read-only from `omp` settings commands and can be turned off by provider id (see [Provider and source disabling](#provider-and-source-disabling)).

## Config file formats

The canonical global file is YAML at `config.yml`; `config.yaml` is accepted as a compatibility filename. The generic config loader used for other files (for example `models.yml`) accepts `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, and `.jsonc`:

- When a `.yml`/`.yaml` path is requested and only a sibling `.json` exists, it is migrated to YAML automatically (idempotent, once per process).
- `.json` and `.jsonc` configs are read as-is, with no migration.
- A settings YAML file whose top level is not a mapping is invalid. On writable startup, `omp` moves an invalid persistent settings file to a uniquely named `.broken-*` backup and exits with the original error and backup path. A `--config` overlay with a bare array/scalar is also a hard error, but is not moved.

## Reading and writing settings

Use the interactive `/settings` panel inside a session, or the `omp config` command from a shell. Both read merged effective settings. Ordinary persistent writes land in the **global** file; model-selector role changes are the exception when `modelRoleStorage: project` (see [Where writes go](#where-writes-go)).

```bash
omp config list                 # all settings with current effective values
omp config list --json          # same, machine-readable
omp config get theme.dark       # one value
omp config get theme.dark --json
omp config set compaction.enabled false
omp config set defaultThinkingLevel medium
omp config reset steeringMode   # restore a key to its schema default
omp config path                 # print the active agent directory
```

For users who want the full first-run animation on normal launches, set `startup.showSplash`:

```bash
omp config set startup.showSplash true
```

This only controls the startup splash animation. It does not rerun setup or change setup state, and `startup.quiet: true` still suppresses all startup chrome including the splash.

### Subcommands

| Command                        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `omp config list`              | Print every setting grouped by tab, with its current value and type. `--json` emits an object keyed by setting path with `{ value, type, description }`. Configured credential fields are masked as `********` in human output; in JSON their `value` is omitted and `redacted: true` is emitted. |
| `omp config get <key>`         | Print the effective value of one key. Unknown keys exit non-zero. `--json` emits `{ key, value, type, description }`. This is an explicit single-key request, so credential values are returned unmasked.                                                                                         |
| `omp config set <key> <value>` | Parse `<value>` against the key's schema type and write it to the global main YAML file.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `omp config reset <key>`       | Write the key's schema **default** back to the global config (this persists the default, it does not delete the key).                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `omp config path`              | Print the active agent directory (honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `omp config init-xdg`          | On Linux and macOS, create the `omp` directories under the effective XDG data, state, and cache homes. It does not move existing files or set the XDG environment variables. Other platforms exit non-zero.                                                                                       |

`omp config` with no subcommand, `--help`, or `-h` lists settings. The `--json` flag is accepted by `list`, `get`, `set`, and `reset`.

### Value parsing

`omp config set` parses the value string according to the target key's schema type. The string is trimmed first.

| Type    | Accepted input                                      | Notes                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| boolean | `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `1`, `0` | Case-insensitive. Anything else is rejected.                      |
| number  | Any finite JavaScript number                        | `Infinity`/`NaN` are rejected.                                    |
| enum    | One of the key's allowed values                     | Must match exactly; the error lists the valid values.             |
| array   | A JSON array                                        | e.g. `'["anthropic","openai"]'`. Must parse and be an array.      |
| record  | A JSON object                                       | e.g. `'{"bash":"prompt"}'`. Must parse and be a non-array object. |
| string  | Stored as given (trimmed)                           | Multi-word values are joined with spaces.                         |

Keys must match a real schema path exactly. There is no shorthand — set `theme.dark`, not `theme`.

### Where writes go

`omp config set`, `omp config reset`, `/settings`, and ordinary runtime settings changes write the global main YAML file under the active agent directory. They do not write arbitrary keys to `<cwd>/.omp/config.yml`. The one supported project write path is a model-selector role assignment when `modelRoleStorage` is `project`; it updates only that role under `<cwd>/.omp/config.yml`, and missing project roles continue to fall back to global roles. To create any other project-local override, edit the project file directly (see [Project-local config](#project-local-config)). Saves are debounced and re-read the file under a lock, so external edits made while a session is open are preserved.

## Precedence

From lowest to highest priority, the effective value of a setting is built as:

```text
built-in defaults  <-  global config  <-  project config  <-  CLI overlays  <-  runtime overrides
```

From highest to lowest:

1. **Runtime overrides** — dedicated CLI flags and feature env vars applied in memory for the current process: `--model`, `--smol`, `--slow`, `--plan`, `--approval-mode`, `--auto-approve`/`--yolo`, `--hide-thinking`, `--advisor`, `--no-pty`, `--api-key`, and protocol-mode defaults. Never persisted.
2. **CLI config overlays** — each `--config <file>`; later overlay files override earlier ones.
3. **Project settings** — `<cwd>/.omp/settings.json` then `<cwd>/.omp/config.yml` (and contributions from other discovery providers at project level).
4. **Global settings** — `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`.
5. **Built-in defaults** — from the settings schema.

A key that is unset at every layer resolves to its schema default at read time.

### Environment overrides

Environment variables are **not** a single settings layer. Each is read by the feature that owns the value, usually as a per-machine override or fallback, and is never written back to `config.yml`. The ones that map directly onto a setting:

| Env var                 | Overrides setting           | Notes                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PI_SMOL_MODEL`         | `modelRoles.smol`           | Also exposed as `--smol`.                                                                         |
| `PI_SLOW_MODEL`         | `modelRoles.slow`           | Also exposed as `--slow`.                                                                         |
| `PI_PLAN_MODEL`         | `modelRoles.plan`           | Also exposed as `--plan`.                                                                         |
| `PI_NO_PTY=1`           | (disables PTY bash)         | Equivalent to `--no-pty` for the process.                                                         |
| `PI_PY`                 | `eval.py`                   | `PI_PY=0` disables the Python eval backend.                                                       |
| `PI_JS`                 | `eval.js`                   | `PI_JS=0` disables the JavaScript eval backend.                                                   |
| `PI_TINY_DEVICE`        | `providers.tinyModelDevice` | ONNX execution provider for local tiny models.                                                    |
| `PI_TINY_DTYPE`         | `providers.tinyModelDtype`  | ONNX precision for local tiny models.                                                             |
| `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_URL`   | `auth.broker.url`           | Env value takes precedence over config.                                                           |
| `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_TOKEN` | `auth.broker.token`         | Env value takes precedence over config.                                                           |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`   | (relocates agent dir)       | Moves `config.yml`, `agent.db`, and the whole agent base.                                         |
| `PI_CONFIG_FILES`       | CLI config overlays         | Platform path-list (`:` on Unix, `;` on Windows); files load in order before `--config` overlays. |

Provider API keys are resolved separately (stored auth, OAuth, `models.yml`, environment, and `.env` files); see [Providers](./providers.md) and the full [Environment variables](./environment-variables.md) reference.

## Merge rules

Layers are combined with a deep merge:

- **Objects are deep-merged** — keys present only in a lower layer are kept; keys present in a higher layer override.
- **Scalars and arrays are replaced wholesale** by the higher-precedence layer. A higher layer's array does not append to a lower layer's array.

Use nested YAML mappings for dotted setting paths:

```yaml
theme:
  dark: titanium
  light: light

tools:
  approvalMode: write
  approval:
    bash: prompt
    read: allow
```

### Bash command approval patterns

`tools.approval` sets default policy by tool name. For bash, you can add ordered command rules with `bash.patterns`; the first matching rule wins. Patterns support literal text plus `*` as a wildcard.

```yaml
tools:
  approvalMode: write
  approval:
    bash: allow

bash:
  patterns:
    - match: "git *"
      approval: allow
    - match: "rm -rf *"
      approval: deny
    - match: "*"
      approval: allow
```

Valid rule approvals are `allow`, `prompt`, and `deny`. Critical bash commands still require confirmation unless a matching rule explicitly denies them; broad allow rules such as `match: "*"` do not bypass the critical-command guard.

Matching is asymmetric so that rules mean what they appear to: `deny` and `prompt` rules fire when the glob matches the whole command **or any single segment** of a compound line (split on `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, a single `&`, subshells, and newlines), so `match: "rm -rf *"` still denies `cd /tmp && rm -rf build` and `sleep 1 & rm -rf build`. `allow` rules must match the **entire** command and never apply to a compound line, so a narrow allow such as `match: "git *"` cannot vouch for `git status && rm -rf /`.

### Bash interceptor patterns

`bashInterceptor` is separate from `bash.patterns`: it redirects Bash commands to dedicated tools rather than defining whether a command may execute. Enable it explicitly and configure regular-expression patterns with a replacement tool and a model-facing message:

```yaml
bashInterceptor:
  enabled: true
  patterns:
    - pattern: '^\s*(cat|head|tail)\s+'
      tool: read
      message: "Use the read tool instead."
```

The named replacement tool must be available in the current session or the interceptor does not block the Bash call. For a detailed comparison of permission policy and dedicated-tool routing, including compound-command behavior and ordering, see [the Bash tool documentation](tools/bash.md#command-policy-and-dedicated-tool-routing).

### Worked example: global vs. project

```yaml
# ~/.omp/agent/config.yml
tools:
  approvalMode: write
  approval:
    bash: prompt
    read: allow
disabledProviders:
  - anthropic
  - openai
  - google

# <repo>/.omp/config.yml
tools:
  approval:
    bash: allow
disabledProviders:
  - groq
```

Effective settings inside `<repo>`:

```yaml
tools:
  approvalMode: write # kept from global (object deep-merge)
  approval:
    bash: allow # overridden by project
    read: allow # kept from global
disabledProviders:
  - groq # project array REPLACES the global array
```

Array replacement is the most common surprise: the project's `disabledProviders` does not extend the global list — it becomes the entire list for that project. The same applies to `enabledModels`, `cycleOrder`, `extensions`, and every other array-typed setting.

## Project-local config

Create `<repo>/.omp/config.yml` when a repository needs its own settings:

```yaml
# <repo>/.omp/config.yml
modelRoles:
  default: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  smol: openai/gpt-4.1-mini
  slow: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5:high

tools:
  approvalMode: write
  approval:
    bash: prompt

compaction:
  strategy: snapcompact
  thresholdPercent: 80

theme:
  dark: titanium
```

Keep secrets out of committed project config unless your repository policy allows it. Prefer environment variables, stored auth, an auth broker, or an untracked `--config` overlay for credentials.

### One-shot overlays

Use `--config` for a temporary layer that should not persist:

```bash
omp --config ./local/ci-settings.yml "check this failure"
omp --config ./base.yml --config ./experiment.yml "try this model"
```

`--config` is accepted by the default launch command, `acp`, and `models`.

Wrappers may instead set `PI_CONFIG_FILES` to a platform-delimited path list (`:` on Unix, `;` on Windows). Environment overlays load in listed order before explicit `--config` overlays.

Overlay paths are resolved relative to the process working directory (and `~` is expanded). Each overlay must parse as a YAML mapping; a missing file, invalid YAML, or a top-level array/scalar is a hard error — it does **not** silently fall back to lower-precedence settings.

## Path-scoped arrays

Two array settings — `enabledModels` and `disabledProviders` — accept path-scoped entries in addition to bare strings, so a single global config can behave differently per directory:

```yaml
enabledModels:
  - claude-sonnet-4-5 # applies everywhere
  - path: ~/work/high-context
    models:
      - anthropic/claude-opus-4-5

disabledProviders:
  - ollama # applies everywhere
  - paths:
      - ~/projects/sensitive
      - ~/clients/acme
    providers:
      - anthropic
      - openai
```

Bare string entries apply everywhere. A scoped entry applies when the current working directory **is** the configured path or is **under** it. `~` expands to your home directory and relative paths are resolved before matching.

Accepted **path** keys (any of them, combined): `path`, `paths`, `pathPrefix`, `pathPrefixes`.

Accepted **value** keys:

- `models` (for `enabledModels`) or `providers` (for `disabledProviders`)
- `values` or `items` (for either setting)

Only string values are kept; malformed scoped entries are ignored. Path scoping is resolved **after** the layer merge, so it reads the final effective array.

## Provider and source disabling

`disabledProviders` is a single shared id namespace that gates two different subsystems, before any credential check:

| Entry kind        | Example ids                                                                        | Effect                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model providers   | `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, `groq`, `ollama`, `openrouter`                    | Removes those backends from model selection, even when credentials are available. See [Providers](./providers.md).                                             |
| Discovery sources | `native`, `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `github`, `opencode`, `cursor`, `agents-md` | Stops that source from contributing context files, MCP servers, commands, skills, hooks, tools, prompts, or settings. See [Context files](./context-files.md). |

Most provider-control use cases list model provider ids. Disabling the `claude` discovery source is different from disabling the `anthropic` model provider — one stops Claude-format config discovery, the other stops the Anthropic model backend.

Because arrays replace rather than append, a project that sets `disabledProviders` must list the complete desired set:

```yaml
# ~/.omp/agent/config.yml
disabledProviders:
  - anthropic
  - openai

# <repo>/.omp/config.yml — inside this repo ONLY groq is disabled
disabledProviders:
  - groq
```

The default is an empty array (nothing disabled). For the two subsystems' provider ids and ordering, see [Providers](./providers.md) and [Context files](./context-files.md).

## Settings catalog

Every key below is defined in the settings schema; `omp config list` shows the full set with current values. Defaults and enum values are taken from the schema. Settings that accept an env or flag override are noted; those overrides are process-local and not persisted.

### Models

`modelRoles`, `modelTags`, and `cycleOrder` work together to define the models you can switch between. Role values may carry a thinking suffix (`:minimal`, `:low`, `:medium`, `:high`, `:xhigh`, `:max`).

```yaml
modelRoles:
  default: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
  smol: openai/gpt-4.1-mini
  slow: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5:high
  vision: google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
  plan: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
  advisor: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:medium

cycleOrder:
  - smol
  - default
  - slow

modelProviderOrder:
  - anthropic
  - openai

enabledModels:
  - claude-sonnet-4-5
```

See [Models](./models.md) for the `models.yml` schema and custom-provider definitions.

### Advisor

The advisor is a second model that reviews each completed turn and can inject advice into the primary session. Assign a model with `modelRoles.advisor`, then enable it with `advisor.enabled`, `/advisor on`, or by launching with the `--advisor` flag.

See [Advisor and WATCHDOG.md](./advisor-watchdog.md) for runtime behavior, `WATCHDOG.md` discovery, and bounded catch-up semantics.

| `providers.autoThinkingMaxEffort` | enum    | `xhigh` | Highest effort `defaultThinkingLevel: auto` may resolve. `xhigh` keeps the classifier one tier below the top, so only `ultrathink` reaches `max`; `max` lets the classifier bill the top tier on models that expose it. The local on-device classifier stays capped at `xhigh` either way. This governs what `auto` _resolves_: a model whose ladder offers nothing under the ceiling gets no auto level at all, and one that also sets `thinking.requiresEffort` still receives its lowest supported effort from the transport — on a `["max"]` ladder that is `max`, because the model accepts nothing else. |

### Sampling

A value of `-1` means "use the provider/model default" — `omp` does not send that parameter.

| `providers.anthropic.serverSideFallback` | boolean | `false`           | Opt in to Anthropic's `server-side-fallback-2026-06-01` beta. Only direct `anthropic` provider requests using the `anthropic-messages` API for Claude Fable or Mythos models are eligible. On an Anthropic safety-classifier block, the provider may retry server-side with `claude-opus-4-8`; every other provider, API, and model is unaffected.                                                                                                                                          |

When the active model keeps failing (429s, quota walls, provider outages) and `retry.modelFallback` is on, the session picks the chain that owns the failing model, by specificity: an exact `provider/model-id` key, then a `provider/*` wildcard, then the current role's chain, then `default`. It skips models whose selectors are still cooling down and switches for the rest of the turn. Subagents get their own per-spawn chains when their agent definition lists multiple model patterns — the first resolvable pattern is primary and the rest become its fallbacks; there is no `agent:<name>` key in `fallbackChains`.

Individual built-in tools are toggled by their own keys, e.g. `bash.enabled`, `launch.enabled`, `eval.py`, `eval.js`, `glob.enabled`, `grep.enabled`, `fetch.enabled`, `browser.enabled`, `computer.enabled`, `astEdit.enabled`, `astGrep.enabled`, and `web_search.enabled`. The `inspect_image` tool is controlled by the tri-state `inspect_image.mode` (`auto`|`on`|`off`, default `auto`): `auto` exposes it only when the active model lacks native image input, and the `/vision` slash command overrides the mode per session.

### Window-scoped computer use

The disabled-by-default `computer` essential tool captures and controls one real host window through native OS APIs. Numeric targets isolate an application without focusing it or moving the real pointer; the synthetic `desktop` target preserves the previous selected-display composite and global input behavior. It remains separate from `browser`, which manages Chromium/CDP tabs and structured page automation.

| `computer.enabled`   | boolean | `false` | Enable the window-aware computer function tool. Every result lists current numeric window ids plus `desktop`; the `/computer` slash command toggles the tool for the current session only.                                                                   |
| `computer.display`   | string  | `all`   | Controls the `desktop` target only: composite all active displays, or use one numeric display ID.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `computer.maxWidth`  | number  | `3840`  | Maximum composite screenshot width in pixels. Image transports that cannot preserve original detail, including GitHub Copilot Responses and xAI OAuth, cap the effective width at `1280`; Claude-family models use the same cap as a compatibility fallback. |
| `computer.maxHeight` | number  | `2400`  | Maximum composite screenshot height in pixels. Those coordinate-safe transports cap the effective height at `896`; other models retain the configured limit.                                                                                                 |

Computer settings are captured when the desktop controller is created. A model switch that crosses the coordinate-safe sizing boundary recreates the controller and resnapshots those settings; changing config alone does not, so start a new session after a settings change. Every call must name `desktop` or a numeric id from the preceding window list. Switching targets invalidates the prior coordinate frame, so capture the new target before pointer input. Before enabling input, configure `tools.approvalMode` or `tools.approval.computer` and grant platform permissions. See [Window-scoped computer use](computer-use.md).

| `providers.webSearchOrder`          | array   | `[]`      | Provider IDs in priority order for `web_search` (`perplexity`, `gemini`, `anthropic`, `codex`, `zai`, `exa`, `jina`, `kagi`, `tavily`, `brave`, `kimi`, `parallel`, `synthetic`, `searxng`, …). Duplicates and unknown IDs are ignored; unlisted providers retain their built-in relative order afterward. Empty = built-in order. Replaces the removed `providers.webSearch` enum (a legacy value migrates to the head of this list). |
| `providers.webSearchTimeoutSeconds` | number  | `60`      | Hard timeout in seconds supplied to each `web_search` provider transport before the automatic chain advances to the next fallback. Use a larger value for slower model-backed providers; values above `300` are capped at five minutes. This is not a whole-chain deadline, and provider-specific upstream or aggregate limits may still be shorter.                                                                                   |

Unlisted providers follow the active session provider and the built-in order. Replaces the removed `providers.image` enum (a legacy value migrates to the head of this list).                                                                                                                                |

### Other groups

`omp config list` exposes many more grouped settings, including: `task.*` (subagent concurrency, isolation, model overrides), `skills.*` and `commands.*` (discovery toggles), `mcp.*`, `github.*`, `async.*`, `goal.*`, `loop.*`, `todo.*`, `magicKeywords.*`, `ttsr.*` (time-traveling stream rules), `display.*`, `startup.*`, `share.*`, `collab.*`, `stt.*`/`tts.*`, `memories.*`/`hindsight.*`/`mnemopi.*` (memory backends), and `bashInterceptor.*`. Each follows the same type/default rules shown above.

## Legacy migration

`omp` migrates older config shapes automatically. None of these require action; they are listed so you know what changes you may see in `config.yml`.

### Startup migration to `config.yml`

When neither `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` nor the compatible `config.yaml` exists, startup builds canonical `config.yml` once from legacy sources, then writes the result:

1. `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` (renamed to `settings.json.bak` after a successful parse).
2. Settings persisted in `agent.db`.

After either main YAML file exists, these legacy sources are no longer consulted. The generic config loader also performs `.json` -> `.yml` migration for other config files when only the `.json` form is present.

### Field-level migrations

Applied whenever raw settings are loaded (global, project, overlays, and runtime overrides):

## Troubleshooting

### A project setting is not taking effect

- Start `omp` from the directory that contains `.omp/config.yml`. Settings discovery only checks the current working directory's `.omp/`, not ancestor directories.
- Ensure `.omp/` is non-empty; empty config directories are ignored.
- Confirm the file is valid YAML and its top level is a mapping.
- Run `omp config get <key>` from that directory to see the effective value.
- Remember that `--config` overlays and runtime flags override project config.

### A global array disappeared in a project

Arrays replace; they do not append. If a project sets `disabledProviders`, `enabledModels`, `cycleOrder`, `extensions`, or any other array, include the **complete** desired value in the project layer — the global array is fully replaced.

### A provider is still available after editing config

- Check whether you disabled the model provider id (e.g. `anthropic`) or a discovery source id (e.g. `claude`) — they are different namespaces with different effects.
- Check for a project (or overlay) `disabledProviders` array replacing your global one.
- Credentials can still come from environment variables, `.env`, OAuth, stored auth, or `models.yml`; disabling a provider blocks selection regardless, but verify you edited the right layer. See [Providers](./providers.md).
- Restart the session if the model list was already initialized.

### `omp config set` changed the wrong file

`omp config set` and `omp config reset` always write the global `config.yml` under the active agent directory. Run `omp config path` to print it. For project-local settings, edit `<repo>/.omp/config.yml` directly.

### `omp config reset` did not remove my key

`reset` writes the schema **default** value into the global config — it persists the default rather than deleting the key. To stop overriding a project value from global config, delete the key from `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` by hand.

### A `--config` overlay fails at startup

`--config` files are process-local YAML mappings. A missing file, invalid YAML, or a top-level array/scalar is a hard error — it does not silently fall back to lower-precedence settings. Fix the path or contents.

### An environment variable beats my config

Some settings (model roles, eval backends, tiny-model device/precision, auth broker, PTY) are overridable by env vars or CLI flags for per-machine convenience, and those take precedence over `config.yml`. Unset the variable or drop the flag to let the persisted value win. See [Environment overrides](#environment-overrides) and [Environment variables](./environment-variables.md).

### `omp config set <key>` says "Unknown setting"

Keys must match a schema path exactly, with no shorthand. Use `theme.dark`, not `theme`. Run `omp config list` to see every valid key.
