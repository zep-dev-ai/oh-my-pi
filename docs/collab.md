# Collab: Live Session Sharing

`/collab` shares your running session with other omp instances in real time. Guests render the **same session natively in their own TUI** — streaming assistant text, tool-call cards, footer state (cwd, model, context %, cost), ctrl+o expansion, `/dump` — no terminal mirroring. Guests can prompt and interrupt the agent; the host machine runs the agent and all tools.

## Quick start

Host:

```
/collab
```

prints

```
Collab session started!
 • Join from another terminal: omp join "mgAYTZwEnpRQtca0CTgn-Q.gdJUbTovD94ofDaa8YvhY0-ty16w4fn8PgB6PLnoA30"
 • or any web browser: my.omp.sh/#mgAYTZwEnpRQtca0CTgn-Q.gdJUbTovD94ofDaa8YvhY0-ty16w4fn8PgB6PLnoA30
```

The browser line is click-to-join (an OSC 8 hyperlink to the full `https://` deep link): the relay serves the web guest client at `/`, and the room id + key ride in the URL fragment. From another omp (any directory, any machine), either form works:

Running `/collab` or `/collab view` starts or displays the active hosting session, rendering both the terminal/browser join links and their corresponding QR codes.

```
/join my.omp.sh/#mgAYTZwEnpRQtca0CTgn-Q.gdJU…
```

The guest's previous session is restored on `/leave` (or when the host stops).

## Link format

Accepted by `/join <link>` and `omp join "<link>"`:

```
<roomId>.<key>                                                    → default relay (wss://my.omp.sh)
<roomId>#<key>                                                    → legacy bare form
host[:port]/r/<roomId>.<key>                                     → custom relay, wss:// inferred
host[:port]/r/<roomId>#<key>                                     → legacy direct relay form
https://host[:port]/r/<roomId>.<key>                             → direct relay URL, normalized to wss://
wss://host[:port]/r/<roomId>.<key>                               → direct websocket relay URL
ws://localhost:7475/r/<roomId>.<key>                             → direct plain ws, localhost only
https://host[:port]/#<link>                                      → browser deep link when web UI and relay share a host
https://web-host[:port][/<path>]/#<relay-link>                   → browser UI wrapper with relay link in the fragment
https://web.example/collab/#relay.example.com/r/<roomId>.<key>   → web UI and relay on different hosts
```

`<link>` / `<relay-link>` are parsed recursively as any accepted link above. For `http(s)` browser wrappers with a parseable fragment, the fragment wins before the HTTP host/path are treated as a relay. This lets `https://web.example/collab/#relay.example.com/r/<roomId>.<key>` open the web UI at `web.example` while joining `wss://relay.example.com/r/<roomId>`. If the fragment is not a complete collab link, parsing falls back to the legacy direct relay form, so `https://relay.example.com/r/<roomId>#<key>` still means relay `relay.example.com`.

The trailing `.<key>` or `#<key>` part is the room secret, base64url-encoded, in one of two strengths:

- **Full link** — 48 bytes: the 32-byte AES-256-GCM room key followed by a 16-byte write token. Grants prompting, interrupting, and subagent control.
- **View-only link** — the bare 32-byte key, no write token. Grants live read access only. Pre-token links parse as view-only.

The room secret is dot-joined in newly generated links because RFC 3986 forbids a raw `#` inside a URL fragment; parsers still accept legacy `#` forms and `%23`-mangled legacy deep links.

## End-to-end encryption

Every session payload (entries, events, state, prompts) is sealed with AES-256-GCM before it touches the socket. The relay sees only:

- room ids and connection counts,
- opaque ciphertext frames and their sizes,
- a 4-byte routing prefix (which guest a frame targets).

Possession of the link is the trust boundary: a full link reads and steers the session, a view-only link reads it. Share both like secrets.

## Guest permission model

Two trust levels, enforced by the link itself — the host verifies the 16-byte write token at join and rejects writes from peers without it (they appear as read-only in the participants list, and the join notice says so).

Guests with a full link can:

- read the entire session (including the back-transcript at join time),
- prompt the agent (rendered with their name badge on every participant's transcript; the LLM sees the prompt text verbatim — names are display-only),
- interrupt the agent (Esc),
- use [Agent Hub](./agent-hub.md) against the host's subagents: live table and progress, chat (steers the host's subagent), kill, revive, and transcript viewing (fetched from the host on demand).
- answer host interactive `select` and `editor` requests. The host broadcasts each pending request only to writable guests; the first submitted or cancelled response settles it and dismisses the other presentations.

Guests with a view-only link can read everything live — back-transcript, streaming text, tool cards, subagent transcripts — but the host rejects prompting, interrupting, and agent control from them.

Everything that mutates the host session or machine is host-only: `/model`, `/compact`, `/resume`, `/branch`, bash (`!`), python (`$`), skills, etc. Guests keep a small local allowlist (`/dump`, `/export`, `/copy`, `/help`, `/hotkeys`, `/theme`, `/settings`, `/leave`, `/collab`, `/exit`, `/quit`).

When a guest joins during an assistant turn, that in-flight turn appears on the first subsequent `message_update`: the guest synthesizes the missing `message_start` from the update's full accumulating message before forwarding the delta. If the host emits no further update for that turn after the guest joins, there is no update from which to synthesize the live component. The durable entry still reaches the replica's message state, but entry frames are intentionally not rendered, so that edge case can remain absent from the live TUI.

## Web client

`packages/collab-web` is a standalone browser client for the same links — no omp install needed on the guest side. The relay serves it at `/`, which is what makes the `/collab` deep link click-to-join: `https://<relay>/#<link>` loads the client and auto-connects from the fragment. It renders the live transcript (streaming text, thinking, tool cards), a subagent panel with on-demand transcripts, and a composer with the same guest powers (prompt, interrupt, hub actions). Run `bun run dev` in the package for a local instance, `bun run mock-host` for an offline scripted host to develop against, and `bun run build` to emit a static `dist/` deployable anywhere (HTTPS required for WebCrypto). The client never talks to anything but the relay, and the key stays in the URL fragment.

Set `collab.webUrl` when the browser UI is hosted separately from the websocket relay. When empty, `/collab` derives `http(s)://host[:port]` from `collab.relayUrl`; explicit web UI URLs must use `https://` except for `http://localhost` development origins. The generated browser URL still carries the relay-specific collab link in the fragment.

## Self-hosting the relay

The production relay is not currently distributed for self-hosting: its Go source and standalone binaries are not published. The endpoint list below documents the hosted service's network contract, not an installable release.

For local protocol development, this repository includes a source-available, WebSocket-only stand-in at [`packages/collab-web/scripts/local-relay.ts`](../packages/collab-web/scripts/local-relay.ts). Run `bun run relay` from `packages/collab-web` to listen on `ws://localhost:7466`. It implements `/r/<roomId>` but does not serve the browser client, `/share` blobs, or `/healthz`, so it is not a replacement for the production service.

The relay is a small content-blind Go service. It keeps no state beyond live connections and exposes:

- `GET /` — the static collab-web guest client (target of the `/collab` deep link),
- `GET /r/<roomId>?role=host|guest` — WebSocket upgrade,
- `POST /s` / `GET /s/<id>` / `GET /s/<id>/raw` — `/share` blob upload, viewer page, and blob fetch,
- `GET /healthz` — liveness.

## Architecture notes

Hub topology — the host is authoritative, guests never peer:

1. `welcome` + `snapshot-chunk` frames — initial state and transcript. The transcript is byte-bounded into chunks so each arrival resets the guest's progress timeout; oversized replicated entries are shrunk before transmission.
2. `entry` frames — durable session entries, broadcast pre-blob-externalization so images stay inline (guests cannot resolve host blob refs). Guests append them with ids preserved to a replica session file under `~/.omp/collab/<roomId>.jsonl` and into the agent's message array, which is why `/dump` and context estimates work.
3. `event` frames — live agent events, fed straight into the guest's normal event controller; rendering is events-only to prevent double-render.
4. `state` frames — debounced footer snapshots: streaming flag, the host's full model object and thinking level (applied to the guest's replica agent state, so model display and context-window math are native), host context numbers, and participants.
5. `bus` frames — mirrored task-subagent lifecycle/progress EventBus traffic, republished on the guest's local bus so the subagent HUD and status-line count work natively.
6. `agents` frames — agent-registry snapshots feeding a guest-local registry, so the Agent Hub table renders host subagents.
7. `ui-request` / `ui-request-end` frames — host select/editor prompts presented to full-control guests and dismissed everywhere once settled. Guests answer with `ui-response`.

Guest→host: `hello`, `prompt`, `abort`, `agent-cmd` (hub chat/kill/revive), `fetch-transcript` (incremental subagent-transcript reads answered by targeted `transcript` frames), and `ui-response`. The replica loads through the regular `/resume` machinery, so theming, ctrl+o, and transcript behavior are native by construction; the guest process never chdirs to host paths.
