# Autonomous Memory

Oh My Pi supports four memory modes. Memory is disabled by default; select one backend via `/settings` or `config.yml`:

| `memory.backend` | Storage and behavior                                                   | Guide                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `off`            | No memory backend                                                      | —                                                       |
| `local`          | Project-scoped summaries and lessons generated from persisted sessions | This page                                               |
| `hindsight`      | Remote, bank-scoped Hindsight memory                                   | [Hindsight](#hindsight-remote-backend)                  |
| `mnemopi`        | Local Mnemopi SQLite memory                                            | [Mnemopi memory backend](./mnemosyne-memory-backend.md) |

Enable the local summary pipeline:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: local
```

## Usage

### What gets injected

At session start, if a consolidated summary or manually captured lesson exists for the current project, it is injected into the system prompt as a **Memory Guidance** block. The summary and lessons share `memories.summaryInjectionTokenLimit`.

- Treat memory as heuristic context — useful for process and prior decisions, not authoritative on current repo state.
- Cite the memory artifact path when memory changes the plan, and pair it with current-repo evidence before acting.
- Prefer repo state and user instruction when they conflict with memory; treat conflicting memory as stale.

### Reading memory artifacts

The agent can read memory files directly using `memory://` URLs with the `read` tool:

| URL                                    | Content                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `memory://root`                        | Compact summary injected at startup  |
| `memory://root/MEMORY.md`              | Full long-term memory document       |
| `memory://root/learned.md`             | Lessons captured by the `learn` tool |
| `memory://root/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | A generated skill playbook           |

### `/memory` slash command

| Subcommand            | Effect                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`                | Show the current backend injection payload                |
| `stats`               | Show backend-specific memory statistics, when supported   |
| `diagnose`            | Show backend-specific diagnostics, when supported         |
| `clear` / `reset`     | Delete active backend memory data/artifacts               |
| `enqueue` / `rebuild` | Force consolidation/retention work for the active backend |

### Capturing lessons

Enable `autolearn.enabled` to make the `learn` tool available:

```yaml
autolearn:
  enabled: true
```

With the local backend active, `learn` saves explicit durable lessons to the project's `learned.md`. Lessons are newest-first, deduplicated, secret-redacted, capped at 100 entries, and injected starting with the next session; a `learn` call does not mutate the active session's prompt-cache prefix. Each lesson's content is capped at 2,000 characters and optional context at 400 characters. Structured memory search, `recall`, `retain`, `reflect`, and `memory_edit` are not available for the local backend.

## How it works

Local summary memories are built by a background pipeline that runs at startup; `/memory enqueue` marks consolidation work that the next startup picks up. The pipeline is skipped for subagents and for sessions that are not persisted to a session file.

**Phase 1 — per-session extraction:** For each past session that has changed since it was last processed, a model reads the session history and extracts durable signal: technical decisions, constraints, resolved failures, recurring workflows. Sessions that are too recent, too old, currently active, or beyond the configured scan/age limits are skipped. Each extraction produces a raw memory block and a short synopsis for that session.

**Phase 2 — consolidation:** After extraction, a second model pass reads all per-session extractions and produces three generated outputs written to disk:

- `MEMORY.md` — a curated long-term memory document
- `memory_summary.md` — the compact text injected at session start
- `skills/` — reusable procedural playbooks, each in its own subdirectory

The separately maintained `learned.md` is not overwritten by consolidation.

Phase 2 uses a lease and heartbeat to prevent double-running when multiple processes start simultaneously. Stale skill directories from prior runs are pruned automatically.

Consolidated output is redacted for common secret/token patterns before `MEMORY.md`, `memory_summary.md`, or generated skills are written to disk.

### Extraction behavior

Memory extraction and consolidation behavior is driven by static prompt files in `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/memories/`.

| File                      | Purpose                                          | Variables                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `stage_one_system.md`     | System prompt for per-session extraction         | —                                           |
| `stage_one_input.md`      | User-turn template wrapping session content      | `{{thread_id}}`, `{{response_items_json}}`  |
| `consolidation_system.md` | System prompt for cross-session consolidation    | —                                           |
| `consolidation.md`        | User-turn prompt for cross-session consolidation | `{{raw_memories}}`, `{{rollout_summaries}}` |
| `read-path.md`            | Memory guidance injected into live sessions      | `{{memory_summary}}`, `{{learned}}`         |

### Model selection

Memory piggybacks on the model role system.

| Phase                   | Role                                                                | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 (extraction)    | `default`                                                           | Per-session knowledge extraction |
| Phase 2 (consolidation) | `smol` (falls back to `default`, then current/first registry model) | Cross-session synthesis          |

If the requested memory role is not configured, memory model resolution falls back to the `default` role, then the active session model, then the first model in the registry.

## Hindsight remote backend

Hindsight requires a reachable [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/) server. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:8888`; set a token when the server requires authentication:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: hindsight
hindsight:
  apiUrl: http://localhost:8888
  apiToken: ${HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN}
```

`HINDSIGHT_*` environment variables override `hindsight.*` settings, which override built-in defaults. See the [complete Hindsight environment-variable table](./environment-variables.md#hindsight-memory-backend) for all 18 supported overrides, accepted values, parsing rules, precedence, and defaults.

By default, Hindsight uses `per-project-tagged` scoping: writes go to a shared bank with a project tag, while recall includes project-tagged and untagged global memories. `per-project` isolates each working-directory project in its own bank; `global` uses one shared bank. An explicit `hindsight.bankId` selects the bank base. Changes to the bank ID, prefix, or scoping rebuild the primary session state so later operations use the new scope.

Both project-scoped modes name the project the same way: take the repository's primary checkout root (so every linked worktree of one repository resolves to the same directory), then lowercase its basename. A checkout at `~/code/General` therefore tags `project:general`. Tags are matched literally, so this fold is what keeps one repository in one memory scope no matter how the path is capitalised.

The primary session recalls on its first model turn (`hindsight.autoRecall: true`) and automatically retains completed conversation turns every three user turns by default. `/memory enqueue` flushes queued tool retains and forces retention of the current session. At agent end, the primary state schedules cadence-based retention and flushes the retain queue; session disposal drains that queue before releasing the state. Request failures and configured timeouts are logged and leave the coding session usable. Subagents alias the parent's client, bank, and scope for explicit `recall`, `retain`, and `reflect` calls, but do not run their own automatic recall or retention.

Recall is injected as background context, not instructions, and recalled memory is also available as extra context during compaction. Selecting Hindsight exposes `recall`, `retain`, and `reflect`; `memory_edit` is not available because upstream Hindsight memories are not edited through this backend.

`/memory view`, `/memory stats`, `/memory diagnose`, and `/memory enqueue` operate through the active Hindsight state. `/memory clear` first drains pending retains, then clears only the local session state and recall cache. It **does not delete the server-side bank**; delete that bank with the Hindsight UI or API.
