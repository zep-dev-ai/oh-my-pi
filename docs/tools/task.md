# task

> Spawn subagents — one per call, or a `tasks[]` batch per call (`task.batch`, default on). With `async.enabled=true`, ordinary spawns run in the background; otherwise the call blocks until they finish. Execution mode is per item: an item whose custom agent type declares `blocking: true` runs inline while non-blocking items in the same call still spawn as background jobs. No bundled agent currently declares `blocking: true`.

## Inputs

The wire schema is shape-swapped by `task.batch` (default on). One unit of work is the task item `{ name?, agent?, task, effort?, outputSchema?, schemaMode?, isolated? }`. `isolated` exists only when `task.isolation.mode` is not `none` **and plan mode is disabled**; `effort` exists only when `task.enableEffort=true` (default off).

- **Batch shape** (`task.batch` on): `{ context, tasks: item[] }` — one subagent per item, all run under the same fan-out rules; there is no top-level agent field. `context` is **required** shared background rendered into every spawned subagent's system prompt (`CONTEXT` section); `agent`, `outputSchema`, and `schemaMode` are per item. `effort` is added only when its setting enables it; `isolated` additionally requires plan mode to be disabled.
- **Flat shape** (`task.batch` off): `{ ...item }` — exactly one spawn per call. Shared background goes into a `local://` file (e.g. `local://ctx.md`) that each spawn's `task` references; subagents share the parent's `local://` root.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `context` | `string` | Yes (batch) | Shared background prepended to every spawn of the call via the subagent system prompt. Rejected when `task.batch` is off. |
| `tasks` | `array` | Yes (batch) | One task item per subagent. Provided names must be unique within the call (case-insensitive). Rejected when `task.batch` is off. |
| `name` | `string` | No | Stable agent name — becomes the registry/IRC id. Defaults to a generated AdjectiveNoun name. Uniquified per session by `AgentOutputManager`. Item field in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. |
| `agent` | `string` | No | Agent type to run this item (e.g. `scout`). Defaults to the spawn policy's default agent (usually `task`); items in one batch call may use different agent types. Item field in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. |
| `task` | `string` | Yes | The work — complete, self-contained instructions. Empty-after-trim is rejected. Item field in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. |
| `effort` | `"lo" \| "med" \| "hi"` | No | Present only with `task.enableEffort=true`. Per-spawn thinking effort, mapped onto the resolved model's supported range (lowest/middle/highest level it tops out at, e.g. `high`/`xhigh`/`max`). Overrides the agent's default selector, including `auto`; omitting it keeps the agent's configured selector — automatic per-prompt classification only for agents configured `auto` (e.g. the bundled `task`); `scout`/`sonic` configure `medium`. Item field in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. |
| `outputSchema` | JSON Schema (`object \| boolean \| string \| null` at the coarse wire-validation layer) | No | Invocation-specific structured-output contract. Takes precedence over agent frontmatter `output` and the inherited parent session schema. Item field in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. |
| `schemaMode` | `"permissive" \| "strict"` | No | Validation mode for the effective output schema. Overrides the parent session mode; defaults to `permissive`. Item field in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. |
| `isolated` | `boolean` | No | Run in an isolated workspace and return patches. Exists only when `task.isolation.mode` is not `none` and plan mode is disabled; per item in batch shape, top-level in flat shape. Isolated agents are torn down at completion — not revivable. |

There is no wire label field: the one-line UI label shown in the TUI/registry is generated automatically from the `task` text by the tiny/title model (fire-and-forget), so callers never provide it.

Runtime stays permissive: the flat form is accepted even while `task.batch` is on (internal callers such as the commit flow's `analyze_files`, and stale transcripts). The model only ever sees one shape.

There is no legacy per-call `schema` parameter. Use `outputSchema` and optional `schemaMode`; when absent, structured output falls back to the agent definition's `output` frontmatter and then the inherited parent session schema.

## Outputs

The tool returns one text block plus `details: TaskToolDetails`.

Background response (`async.enabled=true`):
- `content`: `` Spawned agent `<id>` (job `<jobId>`). The result will be delivered when it yields. ... `` plus a coordination hint (`hub` DM when messaging is enabled, otherwise `hub` job control). A batch call instead returns `` Spawned N background agents using <agent types>. ... `` (the deduped per-item agent types, comma-joined) with a per-agent `- `<id>` (job `<jobId>`)` listing.
- `details`: `{ projectAgentsDir, results, totalDurationMs, progress: [<AgentProgress per spawn>], async: { state, jobId, type: "task" } }`. The call keeps one shared `progress[]` snapshot; `async.jobId` is the first started job and `async.state` aggregates over the async spawns ("running" until every job settles, "failed" if any spawn failed) — jobs that settled before the call returned are already reflected. A mixed call's `results` carries the blocking spawns' inline `SingleResult`s (pure background calls return `results: []`).
- Live progress keeps streaming into the same tool block via `onUpdate(...)`; each final result arrives later as an async-result injection into the parent conversation. The delivery text appends a follow-up hint: `` <id> is now idle — message it via `hub` to follow up; transcript at history://<id> `` (aborted variant points at the transcript only).

Settled response (`async.enabled=false`, no job manager, every item's agent `blocking: true`, or async job body):
- `content`: summary rendered from `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/tools/task-summary.md` with a preview capped at 5000 chars; `agent://<id>` holds the full output. A sync batch concatenates the per-spawn summaries.
- `details.results`: one `SingleResult` per spawn; `usage`, `outputPaths` populated (aggregated across spawns for a sync batch).

`SingleResult` includes:
- identity: `index`, `id`, `agent`, `agentSource`, `task`, `description`, optional `assignment` (internal payload names; the wire fields are `name`/`agent`/`task`)
- status: `exitCode`, optional `error`, optional `aborted`, optional `abortReason`, optional `retryFailure`
- output: `output`, `stderr`, `truncated`, `durationMs`, `tokens`, `requests`, optional `contextTokens`/`contextWindow`, `usage`
- model: optional `modelOverride`, `resolvedModel`, `resolvedModelIsFallback`
- structured result: optional `structuredOutput` with schema source/mode, validation status, parsed `data`, and validation `error`
- artifact metadata: `outputPath?`, `patchPath?`, `branchName?`, `branchBaseSha?`, `nestedPatches?`, `outputMeta?`
- extracted tool data: `extractedToolData?` from registered subprocess tool handlers such as `yield`

Artifacts and side channels:
- Every subagent with an artifacts dir writes `<id>.md`; `agent://<id>` resolves to that file.
- A subagent's own children are dot-qualified (`<id>.<child>`); `agent://<id>/<child>` reads that nested output. When the path names no nested output and the file is JSON, `agent://<id>/<path>` and `agent://<id>?q=<query>` perform JSON extraction.
- Each subagent gets `<id>.jsonl` session history when the parent persists artifacts; `history://<id>` renders it as a concise transcript (works for live and parked agents).
- Isolated patch mode writes `<id>.patch` before merge.

## Flow
1. `TaskTool.create(...)` discovers agents once per cwd through a process-level memo (`discoverAgentsForCreate`) to render the dynamic prompt description.
2. `execute(...)` repairs raw params (`repairTaskParams`), then validates: `schema` is always rejected; `tasks`/`context` are rejected unless `task.batch` is on; batch calls need a non-empty `tasks` (a `task` per item, unique provided names), a non-empty shared `context`, and no top-level `task` alongside `tasks`; flat calls need `task`. The call is then normalized into its spawn list (`resolveSpawnItems`).
3. Per-item execution split: items whose agent type declares `blocking: true` run inline; the rest become background jobs. The whole call runs sync when `async.enabled=false`, the session has no `AsyncJobManager` (orphaned host), or every item is blocking; inline spawns run through `#executeSync(...)` under the session-scoped semaphore.
4. Background execution (any non-blocking item with `async.enabled=true` and an `AsyncJobManager`):
   - agent ids are allocated up front via `AgentOutputManager.allocate(...)` — each item's `name`, or a generated AdjectiveNoun name — one per spawn;
   - one `type: "task"` job per spawn is registered with `session.asyncJobManager` (`id` = agent id, `queued: true`, `ownerId` = caller agent id) and the tool returns immediately;
   - each job body acquires the session-scoped `Semaphore` (one per `TaskTool` instance, resized in place from the live `task.maxConcurrency` setting before every acquire and release), marks the job running, runs `#executeSync(...)` with that spawn's params, and reports progress through the shared `buildAsyncDetails`/`onUpdate`;
   - a failed or aborted run throws `TaskJobError` so the job lands `failed`, but the agent itself stays registered and interrogable.
   - a mixed call registers the async jobs first, then runs its blocking items inline and returns once they settle — the text combines the inline summaries with the spawned-job listing, and the block keeps rendering the still-running background rows beside the inline results.
5. `#executeSync(...)` runs the spawn path (`#runSpawn`), which rediscovers agents from disk, so runtime resolution can differ from the create-time description.
6. It resolves each spawn's requested `agent` type, rejects unknown or settings-disabled agents, and enforces parent spawn policy plus `PI_BLOCKED_AGENT` self-recursion prevention.
7. Model priority: `task.agentModelOverrides` → agent frontmatter → configured task role/session fallback. Output schema priority: per-call `outputSchema` → agent frontmatter `output` → inherited parent session schema.
8. Plan mode swaps in an `effectiveAgent` with a read-only tool subset and plan-mode prompt; `runSubprocess(...)` receives the effective agent.
9. If `isolated`, it requires a git repo (`getRepoRoot(...)` / `captureBaseline(...)`), maps `task.isolation.mode` to a backend-kind hint (`parseIsolationMode`), and materializes the workspace via the natives PAL (`ensureIsolation` → `isoResolve`/`isoStart`), walking the candidate list when a backend is unavailable.
10. Artifacts dir comes from the parent session file when available, otherwise a temp dir. When the session is executing an approved plan, the plan reference is handed to the subagent.
11. Non-isolated spawns call `runSubprocess(...)` directly with parent cwd; isolated spawns run inside the isolation workspace, then commit to a branch (`mergeMode === "branch"`) or capture a patch, and always clean up the workspace.
12. `runSubprocess(...)` creates a child agent session with an isolated settings snapshot (parent settings inherited — `async.enabled` and `bash.autoBackground.enabled` are **inherited** from the parent, not force-disabled; `tier.openai`/`tier.anthropic`/`tier.google` are re-resolved through `tier.subagent`; `tools.approvalMode` is forced to `yolo` because headless subagents have no UI to confirm prompts against; `advisor.enabled` is forced off unless the spawn opts in per agent; per-spawn overrides may disable read summarization and clear extra workspace roots for isolated runs), child `agentId` equal to the allocated id, child internal URL router/`AgentOutputManager`, output schema, the shared `context` (batch calls) in the system prompt's `CONTEXT` section, and the IRC peer roster in the system prompt.
13. Child tool availability: explicit `agent.tools` if provided; auto-add `task` when the agent has `spawns` and depth allows; strip `task` at `task.maxRecursionDepth`; ensure `hub` is present in explicit tool lists; expand `exec` to `eval` + `bash`; strip parent-owned `todo` — unless the spawn is prewalk-armed, whose plan nudge + todo gate need the child to commit its own todo list before the model hand-off.
14. The child must finish through the hidden `yield` tool; up to 3 reminder prompts, the last forcing `toolChoice = yield` when supported. `finalizeSubprocessOutput(...)` reconciles raw text, `yield` payloads, structured schemas, and abort states.
15. End-of-run lifecycle (keep-alive, in the run finalizer):
    - caller signal, wall-clock timeout, or internal hard abort → registry status `aborted`, session disposed — terminal;
    - soft-request-budget abort on a non-isolated kept-alive agent → treated as resumable: the agent becomes `idle` and may receive a follow-up/revival;
    - isolated run → status `parked` without a reviver (workspace is merged + cleaned, so the session is not revivable; transcript stays readable via `history://`), then session disposed and detached;
    - everything else (success and failure alike) → status `idle` with the live session attached, and `AgentLifecycleManager.global().adopt(id, { idleTtlMs, revive })` arms the park timer. The reviver reopens the session JSONL.
16. Lifecycle thereafter: `idle` agents are parked after `task.agentIdleTtlMs` (session disposed; `AgentRef` + session file retained); messaging (`hub`) or the Agent Hub revives them back to `idle`. `"Main"` is never parked.

## Modes / Variants
- Execution mode
  - Background job — `async.enabled=true`; non-blocking spawns go through `AsyncJobManager`.
  - Sync inline — `async.enabled=false`, no job manager, or the item's agent declares `blocking: true` (per item: a mixed call runs both modes).
- Batch mode (`task.batch`, default on)
  - on — `{ context, tasks[] }`: one independent spawn per item, required `context` shared across the call's spawns, with `agent`, `outputSchema`, and `schemaMode` per item. `effort` appears only when its setting enables it; `isolated` also requires plan mode to be disabled. Lifecycle, revival, and concurrency semantics match N parallel single calls.
  - off — single spawn per call; `tasks`/`context` are rejected and removed from the schema, with the same conditional `effort`/`isolated` fields.
- Isolation mode (`task.isolation.mode`): `none`, `auto`, `apfs`, `btrfs`, `zfs`, `reflink`, `overlayfs`, `projfs`, `block-clone`, `rcopy` (legacy `worktree`, `fuse-overlay`, `fuse-projfs` accepted for back-compat); the PAL resolves the actual backend with fallback.
- Isolation merge strategy: patch mode (capture/apply root patches) or branch mode (commit to `omp/task/<id>`, cherry-pick into parent).
- Agent source precedence is first-wins by exact name: project `.omp/agents`; user `.omp/agent/agents`; OMP extension-package `agents/` roots in CLI → project settings → user settings → installed npm/link plugin order; Claude marketplace plugin agents (project before user); then bundled (`scout`, `designer`, `reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `librarian`, `task`, `sonic`).
- Prewalk: agent frontmatter `prewalk` or `task.agentPrewalk[agentName]` can start on the normal model and hand off to a cheaper resolved model at the first edit/write. `task.prewalk` (default off) arms this behavior for the bundled generic `task` agent. Missing/unconfigured targets and exact model+effort no-ops skip the handoff rather than failing the spawn.
- Advisor: agent frontmatter `advisor` or `task.agentAdvisor[agentName]` (`"on"` / `"off"` / model pattern) pairs the child session with an advisor; an explicit pattern lands on the child's `modelRoles.advisor`. Subagents default to no advisor.

## Side Effects
- Filesystem
  - Writes `<id>.jsonl` and `<id>.md` under the session artifacts dir or a temp task dir; isolated patch mode writes `<id>.patch`.
  - Creates/removes worktrees or overlay mount directories; branch mode creates temporary worktrees and task branches.
- Network
  - Child sessions may use whichever networked tools/models their active tool set permits.
  - MCP proxy tools can call existing parent MCP connections with a 60_000 ms timeout.
- Subprocesses / native bindings
  - Isolation backends run through the `pi-natives` PAL (`crates/pi-iso`): kernel `overlay` with `fuse-overlayfs`/`fusermount[3]` fallback on Linux, APFS/Btrfs/ZFS/reflink clones, ProjFS on Windows, recursive copy as last resort.
  - Git operations for baseline capture, patch apply, worktrees, branches, stash, cherry-pick, commits.
- Session state (transcript, memory, jobs, checkpoints, registries)
  - Creates child `AgentSession` instances with isolated settings snapshots; finished sessions stay registered in the process-global `AgentRegistry` as `idle`/`parked` until process teardown or explicit release.
  - With `async.enabled=true`, registers one async job per spawn in `session.asyncJobManager`; completion is injected into the parent as an async-result message.
  - Arms idle-TTL timers in `AgentLifecycleManager` (unref'd; they never hold the process open).
  - Emits `task:subagent:event`, `task:subagent:progress`, and `task:subagent:lifecycle` on the parent event bus.
  - Allocates session-scoped output ids through `AgentOutputManager` so `agent://` stays unique across invocations.
  - Shares the parent `local://` root and `ArtifactManager` with subagents.
- Background work / cancellation
  - `hub` cancel (or parent tool-call abort) cancels background jobs; parent tool-call abort cancels sync runs through the call signal. A hard-aborted run lands `aborted` and is torn down.
  - Missing-`yield` recovery sends up to three internal reminder prompts to the child session.

## Limits & Caps
- Per-spawn effort is opt-in: `task.enableEffort` defaults to `false`; when false, `effort` is omitted from the dynamic model-facing schema.
- Concurrency: one session-scoped `Semaphore` is resized in place from the live `task.maxConcurrency` setting before every acquire and release, then bounds concurrent subagents across parallel `task` calls — both async job bodies and the sync fallback acquire it. Mid-session setting changes therefore affect new spawns and work already queued on the semaphore.
- Idle TTL: `task.agentIdleTtlMs`, default `420_000` ms (7 min); `<= 0` disables parking and keeps idle sessions live until exit.
- Per-subagent output truncation: `MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES = 500_000` and `MAX_OUTPUT_LINES = 5000` in `packages/coding-agent/src/task/types.ts` (overridable via `PI_TASK_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` / `PI_TASK_MAX_OUTPUT_LINES`). Full raw output is still written to `<id>.md`.
- Progress coalescing: `PROGRESS_COALESCE_MS = 150`; recent-output tail: `RECENT_OUTPUT_TAIL_BYTES = 8 * 1024` (last 8 non-empty lines).
- Missing-`yield` reminder retries: `MAX_YIELD_RETRIES = 3`; MCP proxy timeout: `MCP_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS = 60_000` — both in `packages/coding-agent/src/task/executor.ts`.
- Soft request budget: `task.softRequestBudget` defaults to 200 requests (`0` disables). Crossing it injects a wrap-up notice when `task.softRequestBudgetNotice` is enabled; at 1.5× the budget the run is force-stopped to yield partial findings. Bundled scout/sonic agents may impose a lower built-in cap.
- Hard wall clock: `task.maxRuntimeMs` applies to every spawn; default `0` disables it.
- Recursion depth gate: `task.maxRecursionDepth`; `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/index.ts` hides the `task` tool at or beyond the limit, and `runSubprocess(...)` also strips child `task` access at max depth.
- Final inline summary preview uses `fullOutputThreshold = 5000` chars in `packages/coding-agent/src/task/index.ts`; `agent://<id>` points to the full artifact.

## Errors
- Parameter validation failures are returned as normal tool text with empty `results`:
  - `schema` (never accepted)
  - `tasks` / `context` while `task.batch` is disabled
  - batch calls: missing/empty `tasks`, an item without `task`, duplicate provided names, missing shared `context`, top-level `task` alongside `tasks`
  - flat calls: missing/empty `task`
  - unknown or settings-disabled agent type, spawn-policy denial, requesting `isolated` while isolation mode is `none`
- Isolated execution without a git repo returns `Isolated task execution requires a git repository. ...`; unavailable backends fall back through the PAL candidate list (reported via `fellBack`/`fallbackReason`), other backend errors rethrow, and exhausting every candidate errors with the fallback reason.
- Job registration failure returns `Failed to start background task job(s): ...`; a batch that schedules only some jobs reports the failed ids in the immediate text and keeps the started ones running.
- Child failures surface as `SingleResult.exitCode = 1` with `stderr`/`error` populated; the async job is marked failed but the delivery text still carries the output plus a follow-up/transcript hint.
- If the child omits `yield`, `finalizeSubprocessOutput(...)` injects warnings such as `SYSTEM WARNING: Subagent exited without calling yield tool after 3 reminders.`
- `agent://<id>` resolution errors are model-visible when another tool reads them: no session, no artifacts dir, missing id, conflicting extraction syntax, or invalid JSON for extraction.

## Notes
- Parallelism is parallel `task` calls in one assistant message — or, with `task.batch`, a `tasks[]` batch in one call; either way the session-scoped semaphore bounds the fan-out. With `async.enabled=true`, each spawn is an independent background job.
- Shared background convention without batch mode: write it once to a `local://` file and reference that path in each spawn's `task` — subagents share the parent's `local://` root. With `task.batch`, the required `context` parameter carries the shared background directly into each spawn's system prompt.
- Prefer messaging an existing agent (`hub`) over a fresh spawn for follow-up work: it already holds the relevant context. `hub` op:"list" shows idle/parked candidates; messaging a parked agent revives it. `history://<id>` shows what an agent has done.
- Peer-messaging availability is derived, not configured (`isIrcEnabled` in `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/hub/messaging.ts`): it exists exactly when there is someone to message — the session can spawn subagents, or it is a subagent itself. Messaging is the only follow-up path to a finished subagent, so task without hub messaging would strand idle agents.
- Agent discovery precedence is first-wins by exact name: project `.omp` agents before user `.omp`, then OMP extension-package `agents/` roots in `listOmpExtensionRoots` order (CLI, project setting, user setting, installed npm/link plugins), Claude marketplace plugin agents (project before user), and bundled agents. Direct `.claude/agents`, `.codex/agents`, and `.gemini/agents` roots are skipped. Create-time discovery is memoized per cwd for the prompt description; execution-time discovery stays fresh.
- Child sessions do not inherit conversation history. Built-in carry-over is the workspace tree/skills/context files, the shared `local://` root, and the approved-plan reference when one exists.
- When the parent passes `mcpManager`, child sessions disable standalone MCP discovery and get proxy tools that reuse parent connections.
- Branch-mode merge temporarily stashes the parent repo before cherry-picking; a stash-pop conflict does not unmerge the cherry-picked commits — they stay on HEAD, the stash entry is preserved, and the conflict is surfaced separately as `stashConflict`. Patch mode only applies the combined root patch when `git.patch.canApplyText(...)` succeeds; failures leave the `.patch` artifact for manual handling.
- Nested git repos are diffed independently inside isolated workspaces and merged separately with `applyNestedPatches(...)`.
- `agent://` ids are name-based (`Task` first, `Task-2`/`Task-3` only when the name repeats, nested like `Parent.Child`) by `AgentOutputManager`; this is what prevents artifact collisions across repeated or nested invocations.
