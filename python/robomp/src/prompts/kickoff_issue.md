Worktree: cwd; working branch ready for commits if classification calls for code. MUST complete:

1. **Triage first.** Read body and comments via `read` / `fetch_issue_thread`; run `gh_search_issues` for duplicates and already-merged fixes — reporter may be on an older release than the worktree; then call `classify_issue(primary=..., rationale=...)`, including any structured labels (priority, area, platform, etc.) this repo actually uses.

   Before `bug`, system-prompt merit gate: ALL pass — broken contract, demonstrated impact, deliberate-tradeoff check, upstream vs this-repo cause, premise verification. NEVER comment, push, or open a PR before classification.

2. Follow classification workflow; system prompt defines full per-category behavior:
   - `bug` / `documentation` → ack comment → reproduce → fix → PR.
   - `question` → one comment, then stop.
   - `enhancement` / `proposal` → one thoughtful comment, then stop.
   - `wontfix` → one comment explaining design rationale, then stop.
   - `invalid` / `duplicate` → one brief comment, then stop.

3. If `bug` remains unreproduced after a real attempt, call `mark_unable_to_reproduce` with exact needed reporter details. NEVER guess fixes.
